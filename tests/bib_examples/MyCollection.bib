	abstract = {I extend the reduced Greenland ice sheet (GIS) model-module of DICE-GIS (Nordhaus, Proc Natl Acad Sci 25(116):12261-12269, 2019) by integrating snow-albedo feedback (SAF) and potential tipping of the ice sheet into the resuming DICE-GIS SAF model. The increasing global temperature no longer only results in the melting of the GIS, but also in albedo loss, which in turn impacts the strength of the SAF. As a consequence, global warming and the melting of the ice accelerate. The social cost of carbon (SCC) increases because the economic damages are not only related to intensified sea level rise, but also to accelerated global temperature rise. Accounting for the SAF raises the SCC from 37 to 41 \$/tCO 2 in 2020, an increase of 11\%. The temperature increase is the key channel through which the SAF impacts the SCC. The long-term volume of the GIS decreases by 2\%, while the additional inclusion of tipping reduces it further by up to 35\%.},

In this article, a configurable sensor model architecture is introduced. Based on methods of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and functional decomposition, this approach supports a flexible and continuous way to use sensor models in automotive development. Modeled sensor effects, representing single-sensor properties, are combined to an overall sensor behavior. This improves reusability and enables adaptation to specific requirements of the development. Finally, a first practical application of the configurable sensor model architecture is demonstrated, using two exemplary sensor effects: the geometric field of view (FoV) and the object-dependent FoV.},

This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art of ADAS/AD sensor models. The considered sensors are radar, lidar, and camera. To get a common understanding and a common language in sensor model research, a new classification method into low-, medium-, and high-fidelity sensor models is introduced. Low-fidelity sensor models are based on geometrical aspects like the Field Of View (FOV) of the sensor and object positions in the virtual environment. Object lists are used as input and output data formats. Medium-fidelity sensor models consider the detection probability and physical aspects in addition to geometrical aspects of the sensor. They have object lists as input and object lists or raw data as output. High-fidelity sensor models are based on rendering techniques. They have the virtual three-dimensional (3D) environment provided by the environment simulation as an input and sensor raw data as an output. The classification is useful for virtual testing of ADAS/AD functions since the classes can be correlated to the phases of the Systems Development Process (SDP) of ADAS/AD.},

	abstract = {We investigated the interactions of air and snow over one entire winter accumulation period as well as the importance of chemical markers in a pristine free-tropospheric environment to explain variation in a microbiological dataset. To overcome the limitations of short term bioaerosol sampling, we sampled the atmosphere continuously onto quartzfiber air filters using a DIGITEL high volume PM10 sampler. The bacterial and fungal communities, sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, as well as the chemical components of the atmosphere were compared to those of a late season snow profile. Results reveal strong dynamics in the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in air and snow. In fall the two compartments were similar, suggesting a strong interaction between them. The overlap diminished as the season progressed due to an evolution within the snowpack throughout winter and spring. Certain bacterial and fungal genera were only detected in air samples, which implies that a distinct air microbiome might exist. These organisms are likely not incorporated in clouds and thus not precipitated or scavenged in snow. Although snow appears to be seeded by the atmosphere, both air and snow showed differing bacterial and fungal communities and chemical composition. Season and alpha diversity were major drivers for microbial variability in snow and air, and only a few chemical markers were identified as important in explaining microbial diversity. Air microbial community variation was more related to chemical markers than snow microbial composition. For air microbial communities Cl<sup>--</sup>, TC/OC, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2--</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe/Al, all compounds related to dust or anthropogenic activities, were identified as related to bacterial variability while dust related Ca<sup>2+</sup> was significant in snow. The only common driver for snow and air was SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2--</sup>, a tracer for anthropogenic sources. The occurrence of chemical compounds was coupled with boundary layer injections in the free troposphere (FT). Boundary layer injections also caused the observed variations in community composition and chemistry between the two compartments. Long-term monitoring is required for a more valid insight in post-depositional selection in snow.},

	abstract = {Sources of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) in atmospheric aerosols (carbonaceous aerosols) were investigated by collection of weekly aerosol filter samples at six background sites in Northern Europe (Birkenes, Norway; Vavihill, Sweden; Risoe, Denmark; Cabauw and Rotterdam in The Netherlands; Melpitz, Germany) during winter 2013. Analysis of 14C and a set of molecular tracers were used to constrain the sources of EC and OC. During the four-week campaign, most sites (in particular those in Germany and The Netherlands) were affected by an episode during the first two weeks with high concentrations of aerosol, as continental air masses were transported westward. The analysis results showed a clear, increasing north to south gradient for most molecular tracers. Total carbon (TC = OC + EC) at Birkenes showed an average concentration of 0.5 $\pm$ 0.3 \ensuremath{\mu}g C m-3, whereas the average concentration at Melpitz was 6.0 $\pm$ 4.3 \ensuremath{\mu}g C m-3. One weekly mean TC concentration as high as 11 \ensuremath{\mu}g C m-3 was observed at Melpitz. Average levoglucosan concentrations varied by an order of magnitude from 25 $\pm$ 13 ng m-3 (Birkenes) to 249 $\pm$ 13 ng m-3 (Melpitz), while concentrations of tracers of fungal spores (arabitol and mannitol) and vegetative debris (cellulose) were very low, showing a minor influence of primary biological aerosol particles during the North European winter. The fraction of modern carbon generally varied from 0.57 (Melpitz) to 0.91 (Birkenes), showing an opposite trend compared to the molecular tracers and TC. Total concentrations of 10 biogenic and anthropogenic carboxylic acids, mainly of secondary origin, were 4--53 ng m-3, with the lowest concentrations observed at Birkenes and the highest at Melpitz. However, the highest relative concentrations of carboxylic acids (normalized to TC) were observed at the most northern sites. Levels of organosulphates and nitrooxy organosulphates varied more than two orders of magnitude, from 2 to 414 ng m-3, between individual sites and samples. The three sites Melpitz, Rotterdam and Cabauw, located closest to source regions in continental Europe, showed very high levels of organosulphates and nitrooxy organosulphates (up to 414 ng m-3) during the first two weeks of the study, while low levels (<7 ng m-3) were found at all sites except Melpitz during the last week. The large variation in organosulphate levels probably reflects differences in the presence of acidic sulphate aerosols, known from laboratory studies to accelerate the formation of these compounds. On average, the ratio of organic sulphate to inorganic sulphate was 1.5 $\pm$ 1.0\% (range 0.1--3.4\%). Latin-hypercube source apportionment techniques identified biomass burning as the major source of OC for all samples at all sites (typically >40\% of TC), while use and combustion of fossil fuels was the second most important source. Furthermore, EC from biomass burning accounted for 7--16\% of TC, whereas EC from fossil sources contributed to <2--23\% of TC, of which the highest percentages were observed for low-concentration aerosol samples. Unresolved non-fossil sources (such as cooking and biogenic secondary organic aerosols) did not account for more than 5--12\% of TC. The results confirm that wood combustion is a major source to OC and EC in Northern Europe during winter.},

	abstract = {A long-term record of inorganic ion concentrations in wet and dry deposition sampled from snow packs at two high altitude glaciers was used to assess impacts of air pollution on remote sites in central Europe. Sampling points were located at Wurtenkees and Goldbergkees near the Sonnblick Observatory (3106 m above sea level), a background site for measuring the status of the atmosphere in Austria's Eastern Alps. Sampling was carried out every spring at the end of the winter accumulation period in the years 1983--2014. Concentrations of major ions (NH4+, SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ and Cl-) were determined using ion chromatography (IC) as well as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) in the earlier years. Concentration of H+ was calculated via the measured pH of the samples. Trends in deposition and concentration were analysed for all major ions within the period from 1983 to 2014 using Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient. From 1983 to 2014, total ion concentration declined \sim{}25\%, i.e. solutions became \sim{}25\% more dilute, indicating reduced acidic atmospheric deposition, even at high altitude in winter snow. SO42- and NO3- concentrations decreased significantly by 70\% and 30\%, respectively, accompanied by a 54\% decrease of H+ concentrations. Ionic concentrations in snowpack were dominated by H+ and SO42- in the earliest decade measured, whereas they were dominated by Ca2+ by the most recent decade. SO42- and H+ depositions, i.e. concentrations multiplied by volume, also showed a significant decrease of more than 50\% at both sites. This reflects the successful emission reductions of the precursor gases SO2 and NOx. Seasonal values with significantly elevated spring concentrations of NH4+, SO42- and H+ compared to fall snow reflects the beginning of vertical mixing during spring. All other ions do not show any seasonality. Source identification of the ions was performed using a principal component analysis (PCA). One anthropogenic cluster (SO42-, NO3- and NH4+) coming from road traffic or fossil fuel combustion and animal husbandry, one crustal cluster (Ca2+, Mg2+) originating from local geological input or Saharan dust events as well as one cluster of unknown origin with episodic character (Na+, K+ and Cl-) was found.},

	abstract = {Debate regarding the relationship between socioeconomic development and natural disasters remains at the fore of global discussions, as the potential risk from climate extremes and uncertainty pose an increasing threat to developmental prospects. This study reviews statistical investigations of disaster and development linkages, across topics of macroeconomic growth, public governance and others to identify key challenges to the current approach to macro-level statistical investigation. Both theoretically and qualitatively, disaster is known to affect development through a number of channels: haphazard development, weak institutions, lack of social safety nets and short-termism of our decision-making practices are some of the factors that drive natural disaster risk. Developmental potentials, including the prospects for sustainable and equitable growth, are in turn threatened by such accumulation of disaster risks. However, quantitative evidence regarding these complex causality chains remains contested due to several reasons. A number of theoretical and methodological limitations have been identified, including the use of GDP as a proxy measurement of welfare, issues with natural disaster damage reporting and the adoption of ad hoc model specifications and variables, which render interpretation and cross-comparison of statistical analysis difficult. Additionally, while greater attention is paid to economic and institutional parameters such as GDP, remittance, corruption and public expenditure as opposed to hard-to-quantify yet critical factors such as environmental conditions and social vulnerabilities. These are gaps in our approach that hamper our comprehensive understanding of the disaster-development nexus. Important areas for further research are identified, including recognizing and addressing the data constraints, incorporating sustainability and equity concerns through alternatives to GDP, and finding novel approaches to examining the complex and dynamic relationships between risk, vulnerability, resilience, adaptive capacity and development.},

	abstract = {Analyses of climate change vulnerability and risk have been steadily evolving, and have moved from an impact-focused towards a more risk-based approach. In the risk and vulnerability communities, the relevance of resilience and adaptive capacity (AC) are increasingly emphasized. Another emerging analytical framework is the idea of assessing AC and resilience in terms of the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), which studies welfare as a function of multiple forms of assets (`capital') that systems and agents may utilize to both recover as well as increase resilience in the future. We assess a new method for assessing AC at a sectoral level and operationalize AC measurement based on an SLA to assess the ability of the European agricultural sector to adapt to extreme droughts. We create a set of indicators which highlight areas of high or low AC, forecast to estimated times the world will reach 2$\,^{\circ}$ of warming using Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios to drive AC indicator projections based on a fixed effects model. We find that based on this approach, Central and Northern Europe rank higher in overall capacity than countries on the periphery, and projections to 2$\,^{\circ}$C do not change results to a large degree. We critically reflect on the use of this approach and suggest possible use cases for results in larger studies of sectoral vulnerability, and highlight key data gaps and the need for a stronger empirical basis for selection of indicators, which constrain our ability to assess AC.},

	abstract = {Public adaptation to climate change affects government budgets directly on the expenditure side, but also indirectly via changes in the tax base and government consumption patterns. While such indirect effects have been analyzed intensively for mitigation policies, similarly detailed model-based frameworks and studies for adaptation policy are still missing. The objectives of the present paper are (i) to fill this gap by proposing a general modeling framework that allows for a comprehensive analysis of effects of adaptation on federal budgets, both on the expenditure and the revenue side, as well as of macroeconomic effects and (ii) to demonstrate its usefulness by applying this framework to the case of Austria. We find that public adaptation can lead to substantial positive macroeconomic effects on gross domestic product (GDP), welfare, and employment. The results are robust with respect to assumptions about the effectiveness of adaptation. Also, we demonstrate that it is essential for analysis to cover both the expenditure and revenue side, as overall government revenues can increase due to adaptation, offsetting additional direct public expenses for adaptation, thus increasing the budget balance. This is because of less severe climate change impacts and the corresponding lower payments for post-disaster relief and unemployment benefits as well as higher tax revenues. We thus strongly recommend making use of economy-wide modeling frameworks when planning for adaptation, as they shed light on the true costs and benefits of adaptation.},

	abstract = {Climate change triggers manifold impacts at the national to local level, which in turn have various economy-wide implications (e.g. on welfare, employment, or tax revenues). In its response, society needs to prioritize which of these impacts to address and what share of resources to spend on each respective adaptation. A prerequisite to achieving that end is an economic impact analysis that is consistent across sectors and acknowledges intersectoral and economy-wide feedback effects. Traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are usually operating at a level too aggregated for this end, while bottom-up impact models most often are not fully comprehensive, focusing on only a subset of climate sensitive sectors and/or a subset of climate change impact chains. Thus, we develop here an approach which applies climate and socioeconomic scenario analysis, harmonized economic costing, and sector explicit bandwidth analysis in a coupled framework of eleven (bio)physical impact assessment models and a uniform multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model. In applying this approach to the alpine country of Austria, we find that macroeconomic feedbacks can magnify sectoral climate damages up to fourfold, or that by mid-century costs of climate change clearly outweigh benefits, with net costs rising two- to fourfold above current damage cost levels. The resulting specific impact information -- differentiated by climate and economic drivers -- can support sector-specific adaptation as well as adaptive capacity building.},

In a world of inhomogeneous climate policy, missing out policies on either production or consumption leaves an important policy area idle, rendering climate policy inefficient and potentially ineffective. While consumption-based emissions accounts have become readily available at the national level, we here show how their more detailed analysis by sectoral destination (which final demand sectors account for them), sectoral source (in which sectors across the globe those emissions are actually occurring) and the geographical location of the latter can inform a complementary consumption-based climate policy approach. For the example of the EU member country Austria, we find that more than 60\% of its consumption-based emissions occur outside its borders, and 34\% even outside the EU. The top sectors are a very different list under a consumption-based accounting perspective (construction, public administration (including defense, health and education), and wholesale and retail trade) than under a production-based one (electricity, iron and steel, and non-metallic minerals, such as cement). While for some sectors (e.g. electricity) production-based approaches can work well, emission reduction in other sectors (e.g. electronic equipment) is crucially dependent on consumption-based approaches, as a structural path analysis reveals.},

	abstract = {Abstract The majority of freshwater input from Greenland to the global ocean stems from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Currently, almost a quarter of the freshwater flowing from Greenland is derived from catchments that are disconnected from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Despite their importance to the total freshwater flux and influence on fjord geochemistry, there is relatively little monitoring data available for those catchments and therefore the drivers of regional differences in export are largely unknown. We present a dataset of 12\hspace{0.167em}years of discharge of four catchments less than 15\hspace{0.167em}km apart, that are different in size (between 7 and 32\hspace{0.167em}km2), local glacier coverage (4\%--11\%) and lake cover (0\%--5\%). They all drain into Kobbefjord, a well-studied fjord in West Greenland, near Greenland's capital Nuuk. Between catchments, the magnitude of discharge varies at annual, seasonal and sub-daily timescales, due to differences in physical catchment properties as well as local climate variability. We find that annual specific discharges vary greatly (between 1.2 and 1.9 m/year on a 12-year average) due to a longitudinal precipitation gradient from West to East caused by different amount of orographic precipitation shading. The seasonal cycle of discharge (amplitude, timing and minimum flow) differs among the sites mainly due to different exposure to solar radiation as a driver for major snowmelt; the small ice coverage in the catchments plays only a minor role in discharge variability. Dry years generally increase the relative differences in annual specific discharge and no significant temporal trends have been found in the studied catchments. On a sub-daily timescale, the difference in timing of maximum discharge during fair-weather days (>80\% maximum solar radiation and no precipitation) ranged between 7 and 12\hspace{0.167em}h, which is attributed to differences between the presence and elevation of lakes among the catchments. The response of discharge to major precipitation events is discussed, where a delay of between 5 and 7 h is found for the catchments that do not contain lakes near the gauge.},

We exploit high-resolution satellite imagery covering pre- and post-event conditions for avalanche quantification and show that nearly 800 avalanches were triggered during this cycle. The nature of this extraordinary event is put into a longer temporal context by analysing several years of meteorological data and time-lapse imagery. We find that no event of similar size has occurred during the past 10 years of intense environmental monitoring in the study area. Meteorological reanalysis data reveal consistent relevant weather patterns for potential rain-on-snow events in the study area being warm fronts from Southwest with orographic lifting processes that triggered heavy precipitation.},

	abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is one of the major impacts of global warming; it will threaten coastal populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems around the globe in coming centuries. Well-constrained sea level projections are needed to estimate future losses from SLR and benefits of climate protection and adaptation. Process-based models that are designed to resolve the underlying physics of individual sea level drivers form the basis for state-of-The-Art sea level projections. However, associated computational costs allow for only a small number of simulations based on selected scenarios that often vary for different sea level components. This approach does not sufficiently support sea level impact science and climate policy analysis, which require a sea level projection methodology that is flexible with regard to the climate scenario yet comprehensive and bound by the physical constraints provided by process-based models. To fill this gap, we present a sea level model that emulates global-mean long-Term process-based model projections for all major sea level components. Thermal expansion estimates are calculated with the hemispheric upwelling-diffusion ocean component of the simple carbon-cycle climate model MAGICC, which has been updated and calibrated against CMIP5 ocean temperature profiles and thermal expansion data. Global glacier contributions are estimated based on a parameterization constrained by transient and equilibrium process-based projections. Sea level contribution estimates for Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are derived from surface mass balance and solid ice discharge parameterizations reproducing current output from ice-sheet models. The land water storage component replicates recent hydrological modeling results. For 2100, we project 0.35 to 0.56{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m (66{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-\% range) total SLR based on the RCP2.6 scenario, 0.45 to 0.67{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP4.5, 0.46 to 0.71{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP6.0, and 0.65 to 0.97{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP8.5. These projections lie within the range of the latest IPCC SLR estimates. SLR projections for 2300 yield median responses of 1.02{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP2.6, 1.76{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP4.5, 2.38{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP6.0, and 4.73{\^g}\mbox{\texteuro}{}-m for RCP8.5. The MAGICC sea level model provides a flexible and efficient platform for the analysis of major scenario, model, and climate uncertainties underlying long-Term SLR projections. It can be used as a tool to directly investigate the SLR implications of different mitigation pathways and may also serve as input for regional SLR assessments via component-wise sea level pattern scaling.},

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing mass at a significant rate, driven in part by increasing surface-melt-induced runoff. Because the ice sheet's surface melt is closely connected to changes in the surface albedo, studying multidecadal changes in the ice sheet's albedo offers insight into surface melt and associated changes in its surface mass balance. Here, we first analyse the CM SAF Cloud, Albedo and Surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data second edition (CLARA-A2) Surface Albedo (SAL), covering 1982-2015, to obtain decadal albedo trends for each summer month. We also examine the rates of albedo change during the early summer, supported with atmospheric reanalysis data from MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2), to discern changes in the intensity of early summer melt, and their likely drivers. We find that rates of albedo decrease during summer melt have accelerated during the 2000s relative to the early 1980s and that the surface albedos now often decrease to values typical of bare ice at elevations 50-100\&thinsp;m higher on the ice sheet. The southern margins exhibit the opposite behaviour, though, and we suggest this is due to increasing snowfall over the area. We then subtract ice discharge from the mass balance estimates observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to estimate surface mass balance. The CLARA-A2 albedo changes are regressed with these data to obtain a summer-aggregated proxy surface mass balance time series for the summer periods 1982-2015. This proxy time series is compared with latest regional climate model estimates from the MAR model to perform an observation-based test on the dominance of surface runoff in the magnitude and variability of the summer surface mass balance. We show that the proxy time series agrees with MAR through the analysed period within the associated uncertainties of the data and methods, demonstrating and confirming that surface runoff has dominated the rapid surface mass loss period between the 1990s and 2010s. Finally, we extend the analysis to the drainage basin scale to examine discharge-albedo relationships. We find little evidence of surface-melt-induced ice flow acceleration at annual timescales.},

Meanwhile, the range of transient climate response (TCR, the surface temperature warming around the time of CO2 doubling in a 1\% per year CO2 increase simulation) for the CMIP6 models of 1.7$\,^{\circ}$C (1.3$\,^{\circ}$C to 3.0$\,^{\circ}$C) is only slightly larger than for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Here we review and synthesize the latest developments in ECS and TCR values in CMIP, compile possible reasons for the current values as supplied by the modeling groups, and highlight future directions. Cloud feedbacks and cloud-aerosol interactions are the most likely contributors to the high values and increased range of ECS in CMIP6.},

	abstract = {The field work for the AEROSOL Intercomparison 2000 took place from 4 to 14 April 2000 at Melpitz, Germany. One objective was to assess to which extent aerosol chemical mass closure could be obtained for the site. For this purpose, we operated four filter samplers in parallel (mostly using 12-h collections): two Gent PM10 stacked filter unit (SFU) samplers (one with coarse and fine Nuclepore polycarbonate filters, the other with a Gelman Teflo filter as fine filter) and two single filter holders (one with PM2.5 inlet, the other with PM10 inlet) with Whatman QM-A quartz fibre filters. All samples were analysed for the particulate mass (PM) by weighing; the samples from the first SFU were analysed for 42 elements by a combination of particle-induced X-ray emission spectroscopy and instrumental neutron activation analysis, those from the other SFU for major anions and cations by ion chromatography. All quartz filters were analysed for organic carbon and elemental carbon by a thermal--optical transmission technique. Aerosol chemical mass closure calculations were done for the separate fine (PM2) and coarse (2--10 \ensuremath{\mu}m) size fractions. As gravimetric PM data we used the averages from the parallel SFU collections. For reconstituting this PM, nine aerosol types (or components) were considered. Crustal matter, organic aerosol and nitrate were the major aerosol types in the coarse size fraction; the dominant aerosol types in the fine fraction were organic aerosol, nitrate and sulphate. The included components explained 116\% and 86\% of the gravimetric PM in the coarse and fine size fractions, respectively.},

With urban climate science now a fully-fledged field, this timely book fulfills the need to bring together the disparate parts of climate research on cities into a coherent framework. It is an ideal resource for students and researchers in fields such as climatology, urban hydrology, air quality, environmental engineering and urban design.},

	abstract = {Modelling ice and snow melt is of large practical and scientific interest, including issues such as water resource management, avalanche forecasting, glacier dynamics, hydrology and hydrochemistry, as well as the response of glaciers to climate change. During the last few decades, a large variety of melt models have been developed, ranging from simple temperature-index to sophisticated energy-balance models. There is a recent trend towards modelling with both high temporal and spatial resolution, the latter accomplished by fully distributed models. This review discusses the relevant processes at the surface-atmosphere interface, and their representation in melt models. Despite considerable advances in distributed melt modelling there is still a need to refine and develop models with high spatial and temporal resolution based on moderate input data requirements. While modelling of incoming radiation in mountain terrain is relatively accurate, modelling of turbulent fluxes and spatial and temporal variability in albedo constitute major uncertainties in current energy-balance melt models, and thus need further research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.},

We show that this acceleration was followed by a synchronized and widespread slowdown of the same glaciers, in many cases associated with a decrease in thinning rates, and we propose that ice sheet-ocean interactions are the first-order regional control on these recent mass changes. Sea surface temperature and mooring data show that the preceding dynamic thinning coincides with a brief decline in the cold East Greenland Coastal Current (EGCC) and East Greenland Current. We suggest this decline was partly induced by a reduction in ice sheet runoff, which allowed warm water from the Irminger Current to reach the SE Greenland coast. A restrengthening of the cold waters coincides with the glaciers' subsequent slowdown. We argue that this warming and subsequent cooling of the coastal waters was the cause of the glaciers' dynamic changes. We further suggest that the restrengthening of the EGCC resulted in part from cold water input by increased glacier calving during the speedup and increased ice sheet runoff. We hypothesize that the main mechanism for ice sheet mass loss in SE Greenland is highly sensitive to ocean conditions and is likely subject to negative feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Decentralised energy sources, such as urban wind energy, have a number of well known advantages. However, accurately predicting urban wind resource is notoriously difficult due to the complexity of air flows in the urban boundary layer. Without sufficiently accurate methods of predicting this resource, there is the danger that small-scale turbines will be installed at unsuitable locations, which can be detrimental to the reputation of the wind energy industry. Additionally, viable sites may be overlooked, leading to the under-exploitation of small-scale wind in built areas. In this paper, we use an analytical down-scaling method to produce maps of mean wind speed as a function of height for a number of UK cities, via the use of detailed building data to estimate their aerodynamic characteristics. The predictions are shown to compare well with mean wind speeds measured at various locations, except at some sheltered sites which lie in highly complex regions of flow. We then consider the viability of urban wind energy at the city scale. The results suggest that residential properties in suburban areas are often unsuitable locations for rooftop turbines. However, there are many tall, unsheltered buildings in urban areas upon which turbines could access a substantial wind resource. Preliminary results suggest that in the city of Leeds, UK there are potentially over 8000 suitable turbine locations. These results should be informative for turbine suppliers and customers attempting to assess the viability of potential sites, as well as being instructive for policymakers developing subsidies for small-scale renewable energy projects.},

	year = {2010},
	abstract = {We present results from numerical ice-flow models that include calving criteria based on penetration of surface and basal crevasses, which in turn is a function of longitudinal strain rates near the glacier front. The position of the calving front is defined as the point where either (1) surface crevasses reach the waterline (model CDw), or (2) surface and basal crevasses penetrate the full thickness of the glacier (model CD). For comparison with previous studies, results are also presented for a height-above-buoyancy calving model. Qualitatively, both models CDw and CD produce similar behaviour. Unlike previous models for calving, the new calving criteria are applicable to both grounded termini and floating ice shelves and tongues. The numerical ice-flow model is applied to an idealized geometry characteristic of marine outlet glaciers. Results indicate that grounding-line dynamics are less sensitive to basal topography than previously suggested. Stable grounding-line positions can be obtained even on a reverse bed slope with or without floating termini. The proposed calving criteria also allow calving losses to be linked to surface melt and therefore climate. In contrast to previous studies in which calving rate or position of the terminus is linked to local water depth, the new calving criterion is able to produce seasonal cycles of retreat and advance as observed for Greenland marine outlet glaciers. The contrasting dynamical behaviour and stability found for different calving models suggests that a realistic parameterization for the process of calving is crucial for any predictions of marine outlet glacier change.},

At least some of these retreats have been shown to be unusual within the context of the Holocene and have been widely attributed to recent atmospheric and oceanic changes. To date, measurements of the area of ice shelves on the AP have either been approximated, or calculated for individual shelves over dissimilar time intervals. Here we present a new dataset containing up-to-date and consistent area calculations for each of the twelve ice shelves on the AP over the past five decades. The results reveal an overall reduction in total ice-shelf area by over 28 000 km(2) since the beginning of the period. Individual ice shelves show different rates of retreat, ranging from slow but progressive retreat to abrupt collapse. We discuss the pertinent features of each ice shelf and also broad spatial and temporal patterns in the timing and rate of retreat. We believe that an understanding of this diversity and what it implies about the underlying dynamics and control will provide the best foundation for developing a reliable predictive skill for ice-shelf change.},

	year = {2020},
	journal = {Geoscientific Model Development},
	doi = {10.5194/gmd-13-937-2020},
	abstract = {In mesoscale climate models, urban canopy flow is typically parameterized in terms of the horizontally averaged (1-D) flow and scalar transport, and these parameterizations can be informed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the urban climate at the microscale. Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulation (RANS) models have previously been employed to derive vertical profiles of turbulent length scale and drag coefficient for such parameterization. However, there is substantial evidence that RANS models fall short in accurately representing turbulent flow fields in the urban roughness sublayer. When compared with more accurate flow modeling such as large-eddy simulations (LES), we observed that vertical profiles of turbulent kinetic energy and associated turbulent length scales obtained from RANS models are substantially smaller specifically in the urban canopy. Accordingly, using LES results, we revisited the urban canopy parameterizations employed in the one-dimensional model of turbulent flow through urban areas and updated the parameterization of turbulent length scale and drag coefficient. Additionally, we included the parameterization of the dispersive stress, previously neglected in the 1-D column model. For this objective, the PArallelized Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) is used and a series of simulations in an idealized urban configuration with aligned and staggered arrays are considered. The plan area density ($\lambda$p) is varied from 0.0625 to 0.44 to span a wide range of urban density (from sparsely developed to compact midrise neighborhoods, respectively). In order to ensure the accuracy of the simulation results, we rigorously evaluated the PALM results by comparing the vertical profiles of turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses with wind tunnel measurements, as well as other available LES and direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies. After implementing the updated drag coefficients and turbulent length scales in the 1-D model of urban canopy flow, we evaluated the results by (a) testing the 1-D model against the original LES results and demonstrating the differences in predictions between new (derived from LES) and old (derived from RANS) versions of the 1-D model, and (b) testing the 1-D model against LES results for a test case with realistic geometries. Results suggest a more accurate prediction of vertical turbulent exchange in urban canopies, which can consequently lead to an improved prediction of urban heat and pollutant dispersion at the mesoscale.},

In addition to aircraft parameters, the evolution process of the wake vortex is strongly related to atmospheric conditions, including crosswind, headwind, atmospheric turbulence, and temperature stratification. Crosswind generally affects the wake vortex trajectories by transporting them to the downwind direction. Additionally, the circulation attenuation of wake vortex is also influenced by crosswind shear or turbulence related to crosswind. This paper implemented the range height indicator (RHI) scanning mode of pulsed coherent Doppler lidar (PCDL) to study the influence of crosswind on wake vortex evolution. The crosswind was obtained from the non-wake vortex regions of the RHI sectors. The method, based on the measurements of radial velocity and spectrum with the broadening feature, was performed to locate wake vortex cores. The wake vortex trajectories with various crosswind strengths were comprehensively analyzed.},

Since IPCC AR5, our understanding of GrIS SMB has further improved, but new observational and model studies have also revealed that temporal and spatial variability of many processes are still poorly quantified and understood, e.g., bio-albedo, the formation of ice lenses and their impact on lateral meltwater transport, heterogeneous vertical meltwater transport (`piping'), the impact of atmospheric-circulation changes and mixed-phase clouds on the surface energy balance, and the magnitude of turbulent heat exchange over rough ice surfaces. As a result, these processes are only schematically or not at all included in models that are currently used to assess and predict future GrIS surface mass loss.},

Results demonstrate that the significant difference between calculated basal-drag and driving-stress profiles in a fixed geometry disappears when the glacier profile is allowed to react to the surface mass-balance conditions and reaches a steady state. Dynamic experiments show that the mass transfer in higher-order models occurs at a different speed in the accumulation and ablation areas and that the front position is more sensitive to migration compared to the shallow-ice approximation.},

Important results are: that the temperature increase from average glacial to Holocene conditions was large, approximately 15 degrees C, with a 20 degrees C warming from late glacial to Holocene; that the average accumulation rate during the last glacial maximum (between 15 and 30 kyr B.P.) was 5.5 to 7 cm yr(-1), approximately 25\% of the modern accumulation rate; that long-term (500-1000 years) averaged accumulation rate and temperature have been inversely correlated during the most recent 7 millennia of the Holocene; and that the Greenland Ice Sheet probably thickened during the deglacial transition. The inverse correlation of accumulation rate and temperature in the mid and late Holocene suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet is more prone to volume reduction in a warmed climate than previously thought and demonstrates that accumulation rate is not a reliable proxy for temperature. The elevation history of the ice sheet is poorly constrained by the model, and independent evidence is needed. We also present a simple estimate of the response time for thinning of the interior region of an ice sheet due to retreat of its margins. This was approximately 1900 years for central Greenland during deglaciation.},

These data show that many large iceberg-calving episodes coincided with teleseismically detected glacial earthquakes, suggesting that calving-related processes are the source of the seismicity. For each of several events for which we have observations, the ice front calved back to a large, pre-existing rift. These rifts form where the ice has thinned to near flotation as the ice front retreats down the back side of a bathymetric high, which agrees well with earlier theoretical predictions. In addition to the recent retreat in a period of higher temperatures, analysis of several images shows that Helheim retreated in the 20th Century during a warmer period and then re-advanced during a subsequent cooler period. This apparent sensitivity to warming suggests that higher temperatures may promote an initial retreat off a bathymetric high that is then sustained by tidewater dynamics as the ice front retreats into deeper water. The cycle of frontal advance and retreat in less than a century indicates that tidewater glaciers in Greenland can advance rapidly. Greenland's larger reservoir of inland ice and conditions that favor the formation of ice shelves likely contribute to the rapid rates of advance.},

This system combines a mesoscale meteorological model that predicts precipitation, including snowfall in an area, and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that predicts snow phenomena on building scale. The system focuses on snow distribution around buildings, which often leads to snow disaster and snow-related difficulties in urban areas. It can be used for predicting snow distribution due to snowfall and snowdrift in a development area and is expected to be a useful design tool for city and architectural planning in snowy regions. This paper outlines the system and examines its performance by comparing its results with measured data. The snowdrift patterns, i.e. erosion around the upwind corners and deposition in front of and behind a building, obtained by the present model show good correspondence with those obtained from field observation. However, the model under-predicted the decrease of snow depth near the building. Further investigations required to comprehensively evaluate the prediction accuracy of the system are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

To ensure mass conservation, the scheme solves an integral form of the transport equation rather than the differential form. The integrals are computed from reconstructed parabolic splines with mass conservation constraints. For higher dimensions, this remapping can be used within a standard directional splitting methodology or within the flow-dependent cascade splitting approach. A grid and sub-grid based monotonic filter is also incorporated into the overall scheme. A truncation error analysis of the scheme is presented and discussed in terms of results from test cases. The analysis shows that although it has a similar truncation error in the converged limit as that of the widely used Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) for infinitely differentiable functions, PSM is more accurate than PPM for problems with slow spectral decay. Additionally, an operation count of the scheme is given which demonstrates the computational advantage of PSM compared to PPM. (c) Crown copyright 2005.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of semi-Lagrangian advection schemes for a wide variety of geophysical flows at all scales. The approach used is first to determine the minimum computational overhead associated with these schemes and then to examine temporal Variability in the Lagrangian and Eulerian frames by employing simple turbulent cascade phenomenologies. The goal is to evaluate whether the Lagrangian variability is sufficiently slower than that of the Eulerian frame to overcome the computational overhead. It is found that the most efficient semi-Lagrangian schemes require a factor of 5-10 times more floating point operations per grid point per time step than the classic second-order leapfrog scheme.In the enstrophy cascade of 2D or quasigeostrophic turbulence, evolution of flow quantities is considerably slower in the Lagrangian frame and semi-Lagrangian advection schemes can be very cost-effective. In an energy cascade such as the Kolmogorov range of 3D turbulence or the inverse cascade of QG or 2D turbulence, the Lagrangian evolution remains slower than the Eulerian evolution. However, the difference is very much less than in the enstrophy cascade. Since the computational overhead of semi-Lagrangian schemes is considerable, they are at best marginally cost-effective at current resolutions for these flows, which prevail in the atmosphere at scales below 300-400 km. In the presence of stationary forcing fields in the Eulerian frame, the time step must respect the advective timescale even in the Lagrangian frame, at length scales where the forcing is significant. Hen semi-Lagrangian schemes are not recommended.},

	abstract = {The contribution of ice sheets to the global biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus is largely unknown, due to the lack of field data. Here we present the first comprehensive study of phosphorus export from two Greenland Ice Sheet glaciers. Our results indicate that the ice sheet is a hot spot of phosphorus export in the Arctic. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations, up to 0.35 $\mu$M, are similar to those observed in Arctic rivers. Yields of SRP are among the highest in the literature, with denudation rates of 17-27 kg P km-2 yr-1. Particulate phases, as with nonglaciated catchments, dominate phosphorus export (>97\% of total phosphorus flux). The labile particulate fraction differs between the two glaciers studied, with significantly higher yields found at the larger glacier (57.3 versus 8.3 kg P km-2 yr-1). Total phosphorus yields are an order of magnitude higher than riverine values reported in the literature. We estimate that the ice sheet contributes \sim{}15\% of total bioavailable phosphorus input to the Arctic oceans (\sim{}11 Gg yr-1) and dominates total phosphorus input (408 Gg yr-1), which is more than 3 times that estimated from Arctic rivers (126 Gg yr-1). We predict that these fluxes will rise with increasing ice sheet freshwater discharge in the future.},

The schemes, namely Conservative Semi-Lagrangian with Rational function (CSLR0) and CSLR1, are two new variants of the Constrained Interpolation Profile-Conservative Semi-Lagrangian (CIP-CSL) type methods [Yabe et al., 2001]. In these schemes, the subgrid profile is approximated within a single cell by rational interpolation functions. Both the cell-integrated average and the values at the two cell interfaces are employed for the interpolation construction. The interface value is computed through a semi-Lagrangian procedure, while the cell-integrated quantity is advanced via a flux form formulation that is equivalent to a mass conservative remapping. The schemes are exactly conservative with regards to the cell integration of the advected quantity and have quite small dispersion and diffusion errors. The rational interpolations suppress spurious oscillation, and a continuous profile with a smoothness of at least C-0 can be obtained over the whole computational domain. Without any explicit computation of flux or slope limiter, the schemes are more computationally efficient than the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) scheme in the context of 1D. Our numerical tests show that the presented schemes are comparable to the PPM method with regards to numerical dispersion, clipping, and shape preserving.},

	abstract = {Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the largest single contributor to eustatic sea level and is amplified by the growth of pigmented algae on the ice surface, which increases solar radiation absorption. This biological albedo-reducing effect and its impact upon sea level rise has not previously been quantified. Here, we combine field spectroscopy with a radiative-transfer model, supervised classification of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite remote-sensing data, and runoff modelling to calculate biologically driven ice surface ablation. We demonstrate that algal growth led to an additional 4.4-6.0 Gt of runoff from bare ice in the south-western sector of the GrIS in summer 2017, representing 10\%-13\% of the total. In localized patches with high biomass accumulation, algae accelerated melting by up to 26.15.77\% (standard error, SE). The year 2017 was a high-albedo year, so we also extended our analysis to the particularly low-albedo 2016 melt season. The runoff from the south-western bare-ice zone attributed to algae was much higher in 2016 at 8.8-12.2 Gt, although the proportion of the total runoff contributed by algae was similar at 9 \%-13 \%. Across a 10 000 km2 area around our field site, algae covered similar proportions of the exposed bare ice zone in both years (57.99\% in 2016 and 58.89\% in 2017), but more of the algal ice was classed as "high biomass" in 2016 (8.35 \%) than 2017 (2.54 \%). This interannual comparison demonstrates a positive feedback where more widespread, higher-biomass algal blooms are expected to form in highmelt years where the winter snowpack retreats further and earlier, providing a larger area for bloom development and also enhancing the provision of nutrients and liquid water liberated from melting ice. Our analysis confirms the importance of this biological albedo feedback and that its omission from predictive models leads to the systematic underestimation of Greenland's future sea level contribution, especially because both the bare-ice zones available for algal colonization and the length of the biological growth season are set to expand in the future.},

	abstract = {Comparison of numerically computed solutions to exact (analytical) time-dependent solutions, when possible, is superior to intercomparison as a technique for verification of numerical models. At least two sources of such exact solutions exist for the isothermal shallow ice-sheet equation: similarity solutions and solutions with 'compensatory accumulation'. In this paper, we derive new similarity solutions with non-zero accumulation. We also derive exact solutions with (i) sinusoidal-in-time accumulation and (ii) basal sliding. A specific test suite based on these solutions is proposed and used to verify a standard explicit finite-difference method. This numerical scheme is shown to reliably track the position of a moving margin while being characterized by relatively large thickness errors near the margin. The difficulty of approximating the margin essentially explains the rate of global convergence of the numerical method. A transformed version of the ice-sheet equation eliminates the singularity of the margin shape and greatly accelerates the convergence. We also use an exact solution to verify an often-used numerical approximation for basal sliding and we discuss improvements of existing benchmarks.},

	journal = {Surveys in Geophysics},
	abstract = {One of the most striking features of the Quaternary paleoclimate records remains the so-called 100-kyr cycle which is undoubtedly linked to the future of our climate. Such a 100-kyr cycle is indeed characterised by long glacial periods followed by a short-interglacial (similar to10-15 kyr long). As we are now in an interglacial, the Holocene, the previous one (the Eemian, which corresponds quite well to Marine Isotope Stage 5e, peaking at similar to125 kyr before present, BP) was assumed to be a good analogue for our present-day climate. In addition, as the Holocene is 10 kyr long, paleoclimatologists were naturally inclined to predict that we are quite close to the next ice age. Simulations using the 2-D climate model of Louvain-la-Neuve show, however, that the current interglacial will most probably last much longer than any previous ones. It is suggested here that this is related to the shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which will be almost circular over the next tens of thousands of years. As this is primarily related to the 400-kyr cycle of eccentricity, the best and closest analogue for such a forcing is definitely Marine Isotopic Stage 11 (MIS-11), some 400 kyr ago, not MIS-5e. Because the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere also plays an important role in shaping long-term climatic variations-especially its phase with respect to insolation-a detailed reconstruction of this previous interglacial from deep sea and ice records is urgently needed. Such a study is particularly important in the context of the already exceptional present-day CO2 concentrations (unprecedented over the past million years) and, even more so, because of even larger values predicted to occur during the 21st century due to human activities.},

Typically, the downscaling and/or extrapolation are performed using a constant temperature lapse rate, which is often taken to be the free-air moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR: 67C km1). To explore the validity of this approach, the authors examined altitudinal gradients in daily mean air temperature along six transects across four glaciers in the Canadian high Arctic. The dataset includes over 58 000 daily averaged temperature measurements from 69 sensors covering the period 19882007. Temperature lapse rates near glacier surfaces vary on both daily and seasonal time scales, are consistently lower than the MALR (ablation season mean: 4.9C km1), and exhibit strong regional covariance. A significant fraction of the daily variability in lapse rates is associated with changes in free-atmospheric temperatur...},

	abstract = {[1] We examine the extent to which observations from the Greenland ice sheet combined with three-dimensional dynamical ice sheet models and semi-Lagrangian tracer methods can be used to constrain inferences of the Eemian evolution of the ice sheet, of the extent and frequency of summit migration during the 100 kyr ice age cycle, and of the deep geothermal flux of heat from the Earth into the base of the ice sheet. Relative sea level, present-day surface geometry, basal temperature, and age and temperature profiles from the Greenland Ice Project (GRIP) are imposed as constraints to tune ice sheet model and climate forcing parameters. Despite the paucity of observations, model-based inferences suggest a significant northeast gradient in geothermal heat flux. Our analyses also suggest that during the glacial cycle, the contemporaneous summit only occupied the present-day location during interglacial periods. On the basis of the development and use of a high-resolution semi-Lagrangian tracer analysis methodology for delta(18)O, we rule out isotropic flow disturbances due to summit migration as a possible source of the high Eemian variability of the GRIP delta(18)O record. Finally, in contrast with results obtained in some recent attempts to infer the extent to which Greenland may have contributed to the anomalous highstand of Eemian sea level, we find that conservative bounds for this contribution are 2-5.2 m, with a more likely range of 2.7-4.5 m.},

The timescale covers the period 7.914.8 kyr before present and includes the B{\o}lling, Aller{\o}d, Younger Dryas, and early Holocene periods. We use a combination of new and previously published data, the most prominent being new high-resolution Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) impurity records from the NGRIP ice core. Several investigators have identified and counted annual layers using a multiparameter approach, and the maximum counting error is estimated to be up to 2\% in the Holocene part and about 3\% for the older parts. These counting error estimates reflect the number of annual layers that were hard to interpret, but not a possible bias in the set of rules used for annual layer identification. As the GRIP and NGRIP ice cores are not optimal for annual layer counting in the middle and late Holocene, the timescale is tied to a prominent volcanic event inside the 8.2 kyr cold event, recently dated in the DYE-3 ice core to 8236 years before A. D. 2000 (b2k) with a maximum counting error of 47 years. The new timescale dates the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition to 11,703 b2k, which is 100150 years older than according to the present GRIP and NGRIP timescales. The age of the transition matches the GISP2 timescale within a few years, but viewed over the entire 7.914.8 kyr section, there are significant differences between the new timescale and the GISP2 timescale. The transition from the glacial into the B{\o}lling interstadial is dated to 14,692 b2k. The presented timescale is a part of a new Greenland ice core chronology common to the DYE-3, GRIP, and NGRIP ice cores, named the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05). The annual layer thicknesses are observed to be log-normally distributed with good approximation, and compared to the early Holocene, the mean accumulation rates in the Younger Dryas and B{\o}lling periods are found to be 47  2\% and 88  2\%, respectively.},

The response of the dust cycle to last glacial maximum, preindustrial, modern, and doubled-carbon dioxide climates is analyzed. Only natural (non-land use related) dust sources are included in this simulation. Similar to some previous studies, dust production mainly responds to changes in the source areas from vegetation changes, not from winds or soil moisture changes alone. This model simulates a +92\%, +33\%, and -60\% change in dust loading for the last glacial maximum, preindustrial, and doubled-carbon dioxide climate, respectively, when impacts of carbon dioxide fertilization on vegetation are included in the model. Terrestrial sediment records from the last glacial maximum compiled here indicate a large underestimate of deposition in continental regions, probably due to the lack of simulation of glaciogenic dust sources. In order to include the glaciogenic dust sources as a first approximation, we designate the location of these sources, and infer the size of the sources using an inversion method that best matches the available data. The inclusion of these inferred glaciogenic dust sources increases our dust flux in the last glacial maximum from 2.1 to 3.3 times current deposition.},

We present the first quantitative assessment of the microbial contribution to the ice sheet surface darkening, based on field measurements of surface reflectance and concentrations of light-absorbing impurities, including pigmented algae, during the 2014 melt season in the southwestern part of the ice sheet. The impact of algae on bare ice darkening in the study area was greater than that of nonalgal impurities and yielded a net albedo reduction of 0.038 $\pm$ 0.0035 for each algal population doubling. We argue that algal growth is a crucial control of bare ice darkening, and incorporating the algal darkening effect will improve mass balance and sea level projections of the Greenland ice sheet and ice masses elsewhere.},

	abstract = {he need to better understand long-term cli- mate/ice sheet feedback loops is motivating efforts to cou- ple ice sheet models into Earth System models which are capable of long-timescale simulations. In this paper we de- scribe a coupled model that consists of the University of Vic- toria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM) and the Pennsylvania State University Ice model (PSUI). The climate model generates a surface mass balance (SMB) field via a sub-gridded surface energy/moisture balance model that re- solves narrow ice sheet ablation zones. The ice model re- turns revised elevation, surface albedo and ice area fields, plus coastal fluxes of heat and moisture. An arbitrary num- ber of ice sheets can be simulated, each on their own high- resolution grid and each capable of synchronous or asyn- chronous coupling with the overlying climate model. The model is designed to conserve global heat and moisture. In the process of improving model performance we developed a procedure to account for modelled surface air tempera- ture (SAT) biases within the energy/moisture balance surface model and improved the UVic ESCM snow surface scheme through addition of variable albedos and refreezing over the ice sheet. A number of simulations for late Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Eemian climate boundary conditions were carried out to explore the sensitivity of the coupled model and identify model configurations that best repre- sented these climate states. The modelled SAT bias was Correspondence to: J. G. Fyke (fykejere\@myvuw.ac.nz) found to play a significant role in long-term ice sheet evo- lution, as was the effect of refreezing meltwater and surface albedo. The bias-corrected model was able to reasonably capture important aspects of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, including modern SMB and ice distribution. The sim- ulated northern Greenland ice sheet was found to be prone to ice margin retreat at radiative forcings corresponding closely to those of the Eemian or the present-day.},

	abstract = {[1] A novel laser microparticle detector used in conjunction with continuous sample melting has provided a more than 1500 m long record of particle concentration and size distribution of the NGRIP ice core, covering continuously the period approximately from 9.5-100 kyr before present; measurements were at 1.65 m depth resolution, corresponding to approximately 35-200 yr. Particle concentration increased by a factor of 100 in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) compared to the Preboreal, and sharp variations of concentration occurred synchronously with rapid changes in the delta(18)O temperature proxy. The lognormal mode mu of the volume distribution shows clear systematic variations with smaller modes during warmer climates and coarser modes during colder periods. We find mu approximate to 1.7 mum diameter during LGM and mu approximate to1.3 mum during the Preboreal. On timescales below several 100 years mu and the particle concentration exhibit a certain degree of independence present especially during warm periods, when m generally is more variable. Using highly simplifying considerations for atmospheric transport and deposition of particles we infer that (1) the observed changes of m in the ice largely reflect changes in the size of airborne particles above the ice sheet and (2) changes of mu are indicative of changes in long range atmospheric transport time. From the observed size changes we estimate shorter transit times by roughly 25\% during LGM compared to the Preboreal. The associated particle concentration increase from more efficient long range transport is estimated to less than one order of magnitude.},

	doi = {10.5194/tc-11-2491-2017},
	abstract = {Runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has increased in recent years due largely to changes in atmospheric circulation and atmospheric warming. Albedo reductions resulting from these changes have amplified surface melting. Some of the largest declines in GrIS albedo have occurred in the ablation zone of the south-west sector and are associated with the development of "dark" ice surfaces. Field observations at local scales reveal that a variety of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) can be present on the surface, ranging from inorganic particulates to cryoconite materials and ice algae. Meanwhile, satellite observations show that the areal extent of dark ice has varied significantly between recent successive melt seasons. However, the processes that drive such large interannual variability in dark ice extent remain essentially unconstrained. At present we are therefore unable to project how the albedo of bare ice sectors of the GrIS will evolve in the future, causing uncertainty in the projected sea level contribution from the GrIS over the coming decades. Here we use MODIS satellite imagery to examine dark ice dynamics on the south-west GrIS each year from 2000 to 2016. We quantify dark ice in terms of its annual extent, duration, intensity and timing of first appearance. Not only does dark ice extent vary significantly between years but so too does its duration (from 0 to > 80 \% of June-July-August, JJA), intensity and the timing of its first appearance. Comparison of dark ice dynamics with potential meteorological drivers from the regional climate model MAR reveals that the JJA sensible heat flux, the number of positive minimum-air-temperature days and the timing of bare ice appearance are significant interannual synoptic controls. We use these findings to identify the surface processes which are most likely to explain recent dark ice dynamics. We suggest that whilst the spatial distribution of dark ice is best explained by outcropping of particulates from ablating ice, these particulates alone do not drive dark ice dynamics. Instead, they may enable the growth of pigmented ice algal assemblages which cause visible surface darkening, but only when the climatological prerequisites of liquid meltwater presence and sufficient photosynthetically active radiation fluxes are met. Further field studies are required to fully constrain the processes by which ice algae growth proceeds and the apparent dependency of algae growth on melt-out particulates.},

Physical mechanisms controlling the deformation of ice crystal and polycrystal are reviewed. For the low stress conditions prevailing in ice sheets, the stress exponent of the flow law is lower than 2 and the deformation is dominated by the glide of dislocations on the basal plane. The mismatch of slip at grain boundaries induces large strain inhomogeneities partially relieved in ice sheets by grain growth and recrystallisation. The hard X-ray diffraction technique can be used to describe the orientation gradients within grains. The structure of ice along deep ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland exhibits significant changes in the shape, size and orientation of grains. A large variation of ice viscosity with depth is therefore expected. Polycrystal deformation models accounting for the changing theological properties of polar ice are discussed. These models must predict and take into account the intracrystalline field heterogeneity. (C) 2004 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The data presented in part 1 of this paper (Meier et al., this issue) are here used to assess the role of water input/output, water storage, and basal water pressure in the rapid movement of Columbia Glacier, Alaska. Consistently high basal water pressures, mostly in the range from 300 kPa below to 100 kPa above the ice overburden pressure, are responsible in an overall way for the high glacier flow velocities (3.59 m d1), which are due mainly to rapid basal sliding caused by the high water pressure. Diurnal fluctuation in basal water pressure is accompanied by fluctuation in sliding velocity in what appears to be a direct causal relation at the upglacier observation site. The water pressure fluctuation tracks the time-integrated water input (less a steady withdrawal), as expected for the diurnally fluctuating storage of water in the glacier far from the terminus. At the downglacier site, the situation is more complex. Diurnal peaks in water level, which are directly related to intraglacial water storage as well as to basal water pressure, are shifted forward in time by 4 hours, probably as a result of the effect of diurnal fluctuation in water output from the glacier, which affects the local water storage fluctuations near the terminus. Because of the forward shift in the basal water pressure peaks, which at the downglacier site lead the velocity peaks by 6 hours, a mechanical connection between water pressure and sliding there would have to involve a 6-hour (quarter period) delay. However, the nearly identical nature of the diurnal fluctuations in velocity at the two sites argues for a single, consistent control mechanism at both sites. The velocity variations in nondiurnal speed-up events caused by extra input of water on the longer timescale of several days are only obscurely if at all correlated with variations in basal water pressure but correlate well with water storage in the glacier. It appears that small variations in water pressure ( 100 kPa) sufficient to produce the observed velocity variations (1530\%) are mostly masked by pressure fluctuations caused by spontaneous local reorganizations of the basal water conduit system on a spatial scale much smaller than the longitudinal coupling length over which basal water pressure is effectively averaged in determining the sliding velocity. At the achieved level of observation the clearest (though not complication free) control variable for the sliding velocity variations is basal water storage by cavitation at the glacier bed.},

	abstract = {A continuous wave (CW) Lidar system for detection of scattering from atmospheric aerosol particles is presented which is useful in particular for remote sensing of wind velocities. It is based on a low-coherence interferometric setup powered by a synthetic broadband laser source with Gaussian power density spectrum. The laser bandwidth is electronically adjustable and determines the spatial resolution which is independent of range. The Lidar system has no moving parts. The location to be resolved can be shifted numerically after the measurement meaning that a single measurement already contains the full range information. The features of constant resolution and numerical range scanning are in sharp contrast to ordinary CW Lidar systems.},

For Fovea3D hybrid assembly of frequency selected scanner elements was chosen instead of a monolithic MEMS scanner array to guaranty a high yield of MEMS fabrication. All MSM are driven in parametric resonance to enable a fully synchronized operation of all individual MEMS scanner elements. Therefore, piezo-resistive position sensors are integrated on each MEMS chip for position feedback of driving control. The paper discusses details of the MEMS system integration including the synchronized operation of multiple MEMS scanning elements.</p></section>},

	author = {Greve, Ralf},
	year = {1997},
	journal = {Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series a-Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences},
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with anew theoretical approach to model grounded ice sheets in three dimensions. These are considered as polythermal, i.e. there will be regions with temperatures below the pressure melting point ('cold ice') and regions with temperatures exactly at the pressure melting point ('temperate ice'). In the latter, small quantities of water may occur.Based on previous approaches, an improved theory of polythermal ice sheets is developed, which is founded on continuum-thermodynamic balance relations and jump conditions for mass, momentum and energy. The rheological behaviour is assumed to be that of an incompressible, nonlinear viscous and heat conducting fluid; because of the dependence of viscosity on temperature and on water content, the problem is thermo-mechanically coupled. After presenting analytic solutions for a simple geometry (ice sheet of uniform depth), the theory is subjected to a scaling procedure with the assumptions of a small aspect ratio (ratio between typical vertical dimension and typical horizontal dimension) and a small Froude number. This leads to the introduction of the polythermal shallow-ice approximation (SIA) equations.Finally, as an application of the model to a real problem, a numerically computed steady-state solution for the Greenland Ice Sheet under present climate conditions is presented and compared with the real ice sheet.},

Over the Antarctic continent, modeled snow grain size exhibits expected behavior. The agreement between modeled and observed albedo at Neumayer, Dronning Maud Land, is very good, and subtle variability in albedo is well captured by the model. December-February mean differences in modeled and observed net shortwave radiation range from -8.7 to +3.8 W m(-2) between 1995 and 2004, with a mean value of -2.7 W m(-2). This is a considerable improvement compared to the previous albedo parameterization in the model, which led to overestimates of the net shortwave fluxes by +15.0 to +22.7 W m(-2), or 40-55\% of the observed net shortwave flux, in the same period.},

Underlying these is a Unidata-devel- oped system for acquiring and managing data in real time, making practical the Unidata principle that each university should acquire and manage its own data holdings as local requirements dic- tate. It is significant that the Unidata program has no data center---the management of data is a ``distributed'' function. The Network Common Data Form (netCDF) software described in this guide was originally intended to provide a common data access method for the various Unidata applications. These deal with a variety of data types that encompass single-point observations, time series, regularly- spaced grids, and satellite or radar images.}

	abstract = {The Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) is a freely available tool that produces high resolution climate change scenarios. The first public version of the software was released in 2001 and since then there have been over 170 documented studies worldwide. This article recounts the underlining conceptual and technical evolution of SDSM, drawing upon independent assessments of model capabilities. These studies show that SDSM yields reliable estimates of extreme temperatures, seasonal precipitation totals, areal and inter-site precipitation behaviour. Frequency estimation of extreme precipitation amounts in dry seasons is less reliable. A meta-analysis of SDSM outputs shows a preponderance of research in Canada, China and the UK, whereas the United States and Australasia are under-represented. In line with the wider downscaling community, the most favoured sector of analysis is water and flood risk management which accounts for nearly half of all output; research in other sectors such as agriculture, built environment and human health is less prominent but growing. Over 50\% of the studies are concerned with production of climate scenarios, comparison or technical refinement of downscaling methodologies. In contrast, there is relatively little evidence of application to adaptation planning and climate risk management. We assert that further attention to physically meaningful quantities such as wind speeds, wave heights, phenological and hazard metrics could improve uptake of downscaled products. Chronic uncertainty in boundary forcing continues to undermine confidence in downscaled scenarios so these tools are best used for sensitivity testing and adaptation options appraisal. {\textcopyright} 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Here, we developed a stochastic model to quantify the variability in the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints of product distribution and purchase of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) via three prevalent retail channels in the United Kingdom (U.K.). We found that shopping via bricks and clicks (click and fulfillment via physical store delivery) most likely decreases the GHG footprints when substituting traditional shopping, while FMCGs purchased through pure players with parcel delivery often have higher GHG footprints compared to those purchased via traditional retail. The number of items purchased and the last-mile travel distance are the dominant contributors to the variability in the GHG footprints of all three retail channels. We further showed that substituting delivery vans with electric cargo bikes can lead to a GHG emission reduction of 26\% via parcel delivery. Finally, we showed the differences in the "last mile" GHG footprint of traditional shopping in the U.K. compared to three other countries (China, Netherlands, and the United States), which are primarily caused by the different shares of modes of transport (walking and by car, bus, and bike).},

We find emergence timing heterogeneity, with a bimodal structure reflecting interior snowfall increases against a background of low SMB variability, and peripheral surface melting increases against a backdrop of high SMB variability. We also find a nonemerging intermediate region. We conclude that (1) a bimodal pattern of GrIS SMB change will unambiguously reflect the impact of anthropogenic forcing; (2) present-day peripheral and interior SMB trends likely have an underlying anthropogenically forced component; (3) local emergence occurs well before emergence of a spatially integrated signal; and (4) the GrIS summit region may be an ideal location for monitoring regional/global climate change.},

In this paper, we make a comparison between a Lagrangian and Eulerian approach to the ice advection problem in numerical ice-sheet models. This comparison is first performed for a schematic two-dimensional ice sheet of Nye-Vialov type with a prescribed stationary velocity field. Several cases are examined which incorporate basal melting, basal sliding and all undulating bed. A further comparison is made with an analytical solution for the ice divide. Both methods are also applied in a thermomechanical model of the Antarctic ice sheet for steady-state present-day conditions. Our main conclusion is that, for similar discretization parameters, the Lagrangian method produces less error than an Eulerian approach using a second-order upwinding finite-difference scheme, though the difference is small (<1\%) for the largest part of the model domain. However, problems with the Lagrangian approach are introduced by the dispersion of tracers, necessitating the use of interpolation procedures that are a main source of additional error. It is also shown that a cubic-spline approximation of Lagrangian trajectories improves accuracy, but such a method is computationally hardly applicable in large-scale ice-sheet models.},

	abstract = {Wind velocity can be obtained using a laser radar system by measuring the Doppler shifted backscatter from aerosols and particulates in the atmosphere. Doppler lidar systems for wind velocity measurements can be classified into two categories: coherent detection and incoherent detection. The ultimate goal for both types is to measure a frequency shift between the transmitted laser pulse and the return laser pulse. This frequency shift is proportional to some component of the wind velocity, depending on the system configuration. How accurately these systems can measure the frequency shift, and thus the velocity, is dependent upon the system's characteristics. Existing Doppler lidar systems employ monostatic configurations which require scanning a volume to obtain wind velocity and direction. Range resolution in these systems is normally obtained by using a pulsed laser system. This places a fundamental limit on the range-velocity resolution product. The purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing a multistatic configuration for measuring 3-dimensional vector winds. In the multistatic configuration, horizontal and vertical resolution are determined by the telescope field-of-view, laser divergence, and baseline separation distance between the laser and the telescope. This enables the use of a continuous-wave or long pulse laser transmitter (narrow spectral width) and eliminates the dependence between range and velocity resolution. The results of this research have shown that a multistatic Doppler lidar system will provide accurate estimates of wind velocity within the tropospheric boundary layer (up to about 5 km) with high spatial resolution.},

	journal = {Climate of the Past},
	abstract = {A nested ice flow model was developed for eastern Dronning Maud Land to assist with the dating and interpretation of the EDML deep ice core. The model consists of a high-resolution higher-order ice dynamic flow model that was nested into a comprehensive 3-D thermomechanical model of the whole Antarctic ice sheet. As the drill site is on a flank position the calculations specifically take into account the effects of horizontal advection as deeper ice in the core originated from higher inland. First the regional velocity field and ice sheet geometry is obtained from a forward experiment over the last 8 glacial cycles. The result is subsequently employed in a Lagrangian backtracing algorithm to provide particle paths back to their time and place of deposition. The procedure directly yields the depth-age distribution, surface conditions at particle origin, and a suite of relevant parameters such as initial annual layer thickness. This paper discusses the method and the main results of the experiment, including the ice core chronology, the non-climatic corrections needed to extract the climatic part of the signal, and the thinning function. The focus is on the upper 89\% of the ice core (appr. 170 kyears) as the dating below that is increasingly less robust owing to the unknown value of the geothermal heat flux. It is found that the temperature biases resulting from variations of surface elevation are up to half of the magnitude of the climatic changes themselves.},

It becomes even more significant when such system is supposed to reliably support state-of-the-art devices, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), emerging at rapid pace in our surroundings. Contemporary network deployments, addressing mainly the needs of terrestrial users, were not optimized to serve UAVs moving below and above the typical cellular antenna heights. Thus, it is worth checking how they can handle these novel and distinctive services, also with respect to mobility robustness. This paper elaborates on the challenges ahead which must be tackled to make existing LTE networks sufficiently capable of accommodating Aerial Vehicles. We present simulation results in various environments, obtained for different user equipment's (UE's) heights and velocities. Furthermore, we describe and analyze the identified issues. Finally, we also suggest potential optimizations and future research goals.},

	abstract = {[1] The volume fraction of liquid water in temperate glacier ice is important not only for the flow of glaciers and the analysis and processing of ground penetrating radar data from glaciers but also for the stability of the thermal layering in polythermal glaciers. However, little is known about the spatial variations of water content in glaciers. We use relative backscatter strength of ground-penetrating radar signals to estimate the spatial distribution of water content close to the cold-temperate transition on Storglaciaren, northern Sweden, in an area close to the equilibrium line. The values of relative backscatter strength are calibrated using determinations of absolute water content from temperature measurements across the cold-temperate transition and the thermodynamic boundary condition at the freezing front. The results show a water content of 0.80\%, 0.75\%, and 0.58\% at three calibration points and a mean water content of 0.8\% with a standard deviation of +/- 0.26\% for the extrapolated water content. The extrapolated water content shows a distinct pattern, with lower water content on one side of the glacier center line and higher water content on the other side, with higher water content on the northern side. We hypothesize that the different water contents result from the fact that the ice on either side of the center line originates from different cirques, thus implying spatial variations in the entrapment of water in the firn-ice transition process in the different cirques.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric dust is an important feedback in the climate system, potentially affecting the radiative balance and chemical composition of the atmosphere and providing nutrients to terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Yet the potential impact of dust on the climate system, both in the anthropogenically disturbed future and the naturally varying past, remains to be quantified. The geologic record of dust provides the opportunity to test earth system models designed to simulate dust. Records of dust can be obtained from ice cores, marine sediments, and terrestrial (loess) deposits. Although rarely unequivocal, these records document a variety of processes (source, transport and deposition) in the dust cycle, stored in each archive as changes in clay mineralogy, isotopes, grain size, and concentration of terrigenous materials. Although the extraction of information from each type of archive is slightly different, the basic controls on these dust indicators are the same. Changes in the dust flux and particle size might be controlled by a combination of (a) source area extent, (b) dust emission efficiency (wind speed) and atmospheric transport, (c) atmospheric residence time of dust, and/or (d) relative contributions of dry settling and rainout of dust. Similarly, changes in mineralogy reflect (a) source area mineralogy and weathering and (b) shifts in atmospheric transport. The combination of these geological data with process-based, forward-modelling schemes in global earth system models provides an excellent means of achieving a comprehensive picture of the global pattern of dust accumulation rates, their controlling mechanisms, and how those mechanisms may vary regionally. The Dust Indicators and Records of Terrestrial and MArine Palaeoenvironments (DIRTMAP) data base has been established to provide a global palaeoenvironmental data set that can be used to validate earth system model simulations of the dust cycle over the past 150,000 years.

Semi-Lagrangian advection algorithms are also extended to staggered Cartesian meshes with cut boundary cells. A linear reconstruction algorithm and radial basis function interpolation are used, respectively, to compute approximate trajectories and to recover an accurate velocity field in cells intersected by the boundary. The effective accuracy of radial basis function interpolators for semi-Lagrangian algorithms is assessed by simple numerical experiments. Timestep control techniques in the computation of the semi-Lagrangian trajectories are also discussed. The accuracy of the resulting models for environmental flows is demonstrated by a number of test cases simulating nonlinear open channel flows and baroclinic flows over an isolated obstacle.

Since melt is critically modulated by surface albedo, understanding the processes and feedbacks that alter albedo is a prerequisite for accurately forecasting mass loss. Using satellite imagery, we demonstrate the importance of Greenland's seasonally fluctuating snowline, which reduces ice sheet albedo and enhances melt by exposing dark bare ice. From 2001 to 2017, this process drove 53\% of net shortwave radiation variability in the ablation zone and amplified ice sheet melt five times more than hydrological and biological processes that darken bare ice itself. In a warmer climate , snowline fluctuations will exert an even greater control on melt due to flatter ice sheet topography at higher elevations. Current climate models, however, inaccurately predict snowline elevations during high melt years, portending an unforeseen uncertainty in forecasts of Greenland's runoff contribution to global sea level rise.},

	abstract = {Simulation of urban airflow and ventilation potential is desirable for building design, however the complex and transient nature of flows in urban environments makes this a challenging task. This study aims to evaluate the capability of a lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) code deployed on a graphical processing unit (GPU) using a large eddy sub-grid turbulence model for cross-flow ventilation of an idealised cubical building at wind-tunnel scale. ANSYS Fluent is used as a numerical comparison. Fa{\c{c}}ade pressure and ventilation of the cube are investigated for parallel and perpendicular wind directions with the building in isolation and regular array format. Pressures, velocities and ventilation rates are compared to experimental data from wind tunnel and full-scale experiments of the Silsoe cube. Simulations compare favourably with experimental values and between each other. When the cube was surrounded by other cubes, simulations suggest that vortex shedding from up-wind buildings provides pulsating ventilation, improving airflow ingress in the parallel wind cases. A parametric study showed that doubling surrounding building height had a small negative effect on ventilation but was mitigated by high levels of downdraft and flow fluctuations in the vertical plane. Comparatively, doubling the central building height had a net positive effect but caused high internal airspeeds for both angles. The LBM code running on one GPU was several orders of magnitude faster than Fluent with similar accuracy. Simulation time using the LBM approach was several orders of magnitude lower than Fluent.},

	year = {1997},
	abstract = {Sensitivity experiments are conducted to test the influence of poorly known model parameters on the simulation of the Greenland ice sheet by means of a three dimensional numerical model including the mechanical and thermal processes within the ice. Two types of experiments are performed: steady-state climatic conditions and simulations over the last climatic cycle with a climatic forcing derived from the GRIP record. The experiments show that the maximum altitude of the ice sheet depends on the ice flow parameters (deformation and sliding law coefficients, geothermal flux) and that it is low when the ice flow is fast. On the other hand, the maximum altitude is not sensitive to the ablation strength and consequently during the climatic cycle it is driven by changes in accumulation rate. The ice sheet extension shows the opposite sensitivity: it is barely affected by ice flow velocity and the ice covered area is smaller for large ablation coefficients. For colder climates, when there is no ablation, the ice sheet extension depends on the sea level. An interesting result is that the variations with time of the altitude at the ice divide (Summit) do not depend on the parameters we tested. The present modelled ice sheets resulting from the climatic cycle experiments are compared with the present measured ice sheet in order to find the set of parameters that gives the best fit between modelled and measured geometry. It seems that, compared to the parameter set most commonly used, higher ablation rate coefficients must be used.},

	abstract = {A physically-based statistical modeling approach to downscale coarse resolution reanalysis near-surface winds over a region of complex terrain is developed and tested in this study. Our approach is guided by physical variables and meteorological relationships that are important for determining near-surface wind flow. Preliminary fine scale winds are estimated by correcting the course-to-fine grid resolution mismatch in roughness length. Guided by the physics shaping near-surface winds, we then formulate a multivariable linear regression model which uses near-surface micrometeorological variables and the preliminary estimates as predictors to calculate the final wind products. The coarse-to-fine grid resolution ratio is approximately 10--1 for our study region of southern California. A validated 3-km resolution dynamically-downscaled wind dataset is used to train and validate our method. Winds from our statistical modeling approach accurately reproduce the dynamically-downscaled near-surface wind field with wind speed magnitude and wind direction errors of <1.5 ms<sup>-1</sup> and 30$\,^{\circ}$, respectively. This approach can greatly accelerate the production of near-surface wind fields that are much more accurate than reanalysis data, while limiting the amount of computational and time intensive dynamical downscaling. Future studies will evaluate the ability of this approach to downscale other reanalysis data and climate model outputs with varying coarse-to-fine grid resolutions and domains of interest.},

This glacier has an extensive data set of geophysical measurements available spanning several decades, that allow for constraints on model descriptions. Consistent with this data set, we included a simple model accounting for the formation of superimposed ice. Diagnostic results indicated that a dynamic adaptation of the free surface is necessary, to prevent non-physically high velocities in a region of under determined bedrock depths. Observations from ground penetrating radar of the basal thermal state agree very well with model predictions, while the dip angles of isochrones in radar data also match reasonably well with modelled isochrones, despite the numerical deficiencies of estimating ages with a steady state model.Prognostic runs for 53 years, using a constant accumulation/ ablation pattern starting from the steady state solution obtained from the configuration of the 1977 DEM show that: 1 the unrealistic velocities in the under determined parts of the DEM quickly damp out; 2 the free surface evolution matches well measured elevation changes; 3 the retreat of the glacier under this scenario continues with the glacier tongue in a projection to 2030 being situated approximate to 500 m behind the position in 1977.},

	abstract = {An important aspect of semi-Lagrangian models is the determination of departure points. This involves the calculation of particle displacements and is done by integrating a discrete form of the trajectory, or kinematic, equation. The way this equation is discretized affects the stability and accuracy of the equation set. Additionally, recent work in the context of a time-centred, semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian scheme has shown that the form of the discrete kinematic equation reflects the preservation or violation of a dynamical equivalence between momentum and angular momentum formulations. Here that work is extended to the case of off-centred semi-implicit time weighting as used in most semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian models. Two types of discretization of the trajectory equation are identified which preserve dynamical equivalence: some existing discretizations are found to be approximations to them. It is also shown how to incorporate physical forcings and/or predictor-corrector dynamics into the formulation. Two simple model problems (for solid-body rotation and wave motion) are used to provide some further insight into the accuracy and stability properties of various trajectory schemes, including: dynamically-equivalent schemes, approximations to these, and several existing schemes.},

	abstract = {Measuring microbial abundance in glacier ice and identifying its controls is essential for a better understanding and quantification of biogeochemical processes in glacial ecosystems. However, cell enumeration of glacier ice samples is challenging due to typically low cell numbers and the presence of interfering mineral particles. We quantified for the first time the abundance of microbial cells in surface ice from geographically distinct sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet, using three enumeration methods: epifluorescence microscopy (EFM), flow cytometry (FCM) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition, we reviewed published data on microbial abundance in glacier ice and tested the three methods on artificial ice samples of realistic cell (10^2  10^7 cells ml-1) and mineral particle (0.1  100 mg/ml) concentrations, simulating a range of glacial ice types, from clean subsurface ice to surface ice to sediment-laden basal ice. We then used multivariate statistical analysis to identify factors responsible for the variation in microbial abundance on the ice sheet. EFM gave the most accurate and reproducible results of the tested methodologies, and was therefore selected as the most suitable technique for cell enumeration of ice containing dust. Cell numbers in surface ice samples, determined by EFM, ranged from ca 2 x 10^3 to ca 2 x 10^6 cells/ml while dust concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 2 mg/ml. The lowest abundances were found in ice sampled from the accumulation area of the ice sheet and in samples affected by fresh snow; these samples may be considered as a reference point of the cell abundance of precipitants that are deposited on the ice sheet surface. Dust content was the most significant variable to explain the variation in the abundance data, which suggests a direct association between deposited dust particles and cells and/or by their provision of limited nutrients to microbial communities on the Greenland Ice Sheet.},

Such data could be used in the evaluation of modelled surface mass balance, or to document changes in glacier melt independently from model output. Here, we present a comprehensive database of Greenland glacier surface mass-balance observations from the ablation area of the ice sheet and local glaciers. The database spans the 123 a from 1892 to 2015, contains a total of  measurements from 46 sites, and is openly accessible through the PROMICE web portal ( <uri href="http://www.promice.dk" type="simple">http://www.promice.dk</uri> ). For each measurement we provide <italic>X, Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> coordinates, starting and ending dates as well as quality flags. We give sources for each entry and for all metadata. Two thirds of the data were collected from grey literature and unpublished archive documents. Roughly 60\% of the measurements were performed by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS, previously GGU). The data cover all regions of Greenland except for the southernmost part of the east coast, but also emphasize the importance of long-term time series of which there are only two exceeding 20 a. We use the data to analyse uncertainties in point measurements of surface mass balance, as well as to estimate surface mass-balance profiles for most regions of Greenland. </p>},

The aim is to use expressive data structures available in the scientific Python ecosystem along with best practices in software design to allow scientists to easily and reliably combine model components to represent the climate system at a desired level of complexity and to enable users to fully understand what the model is doing. sympl is a framework which formulates the model in terms of a state that gets evolved forward in time or modified within a specific time by well-defined components. sympl's design facilitates building models that are self-documenting, are highly interoperable, and provide fine-grained control over model components and behaviour. sympl components contain all relevant information about the input they expect and output that they provide. Components are designed to be easily interchanged, even when they rely on different units or array configurations. sympl provides basic functions and objects which could be used in any type of Earth system model. climt is an Earth system modelling toolkit that contains scientific components built using sympl base objects. These include both pure Python components and wrapped Fortran libraries. climt provides functionality requiring model-specific assumptions, such as state initialization and grid configuration. climt's programming interface designed to be easy to use and thus appealing to a wide audience. Model building, configuration and execution are performed through a Python script (or Jupyter Notebook), enabling researchers to build an end-to-end Python-based pipeline along with popular Python data analysis and visualization tools.},

	abstract = {Measurements of glacier flow velocity and basal water pressure at two sites on Columbia Glacier, Alaska, are combined with meteorological and hydrologic data to provide an observational basis for assessing the role of water storage and basal water pressure in the rapid movement of this large glacier. During the period from July 5 to August 31, 1987, coordinated observations were made of glacier surface motion and of water level in five boreholes drilled to (or in one case near to) the glacier bed at two sites, 5 and 12 km from the terminus. Glacier velocities increased downglacier in this reach from about 4 m d-1 to about 7 m d-1. Three types of time variation in velocity and other variables were revealed: (1) Diurnal fluctuation in water input/output, borehole water level, and ice velocity (fluctuation amplitude 5 to 8\%); (2) Speed-up events in glacier motion (15-30\% speed up), lasting about 3 days, and occurring at times of enhanced input of water, in some cases from rain and in others from ice ablation enhanced by strong, warm winds; (3) ''Extra-slowdown'' events, in which, after a speed-up event, the ice velocity decreased in about 3 days to a level consistently lower than that prior to the speed-up event. All of the time variations in velocity were due, directly or indirectly, to variations in water input to the glacier. The role of basal water in causing the observed glacier motions is interpreted by Kamb et al. (this issue).},

	abstract = {Abstract. The fusion of drone and wind lidar technology introduces the exciting possibility of performing high-quality wind measurements virtually anywhere. We present a proof-of-concept (POC) drone--lidar system and report results from several test campaigns that demonstrate its ability to measure accurate wind speeds. The POC system is based on a dual-telescope continuous-wave (CW) lidar, with drone-borne telescopes and ground-based optoelectronics. Commercially available drone and gimbal units are employed. The demonstration campaigns started with a series of comparisons of the wind speed measurements acquired by the POC system to simultaneous measurements performed by nearby mast-based sensors. On average, an agreement down to about 0.1 m s-1 between mast- and drone-based measurements of the horizontal wind speed is found. Subsequently, the extent of the flow disturbance caused by the drone downwash was investigated. These tests vindicated the somewhat conservative choice of lidar measurement ranges made for the initial wind speed comparisons. Overall, the excellent results obtained without any drone motion correction and with fairly primitive drone position control indicate the potential of drone--lidar systems in terms of accuracy and applications. The next steps in the development are outlined and several potential applications are discussed.},

	journal = {Monthly Weather Review},
	abstract = {Through the use of the dimensional splitting ''cascade'' method of grid-to-grid interpolation, it is shown that consistently high-order-accurate semi-Lagrangian integration of a three-dimensional hydrostatic primitive equations model can be carried out using forward (downstream) trajectories instead of the backward (upstream) trajectory computations that are more commonly employed in semi-Lagrangian models. Apart from the efficiency resulting directly from the adoption of the cascade method, improved computational performance is achieved partly by the selective implicit treatment of only the deepest vertical gravity modes and partly by obviating the need to iterate the estimation of each trajectory's location. Perhaps the main distinction of our present semi-Lagrangian method is its inherent exact conservation of mass and passive tracers. This is achieved by adopting a simple variant of the cascade interpolation that incorporates mass (and tracer) conservation directly and at only a very modest additional cost. The conserving cascade, which is described in detail, is a generic algorithm that can be applied at arbitrary order of accuracy.Tests of the new mass-conserving scheme in a regional forecast model show small but consistent improvements in accuracy at 48 h. It is suggested that the benefits to extended global forecasting and simulation should be much greater.},

However, direct comparison between ground and satellite-derived albedo can only be justified when the measured surface is homogeneous at the length-scale of both satellite pixel and in situ footprint. Here we use digital imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle to evaluate point-to-pixel albedo comparisons across the western, ablating margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results reveal that in situ measurements overestimate albedo by up to 0.10 at the end of the melt season because the ground footprints of AWS-mounted pyranometers are insufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the ice surface as it progressively ablates and darkens. Statistical analysis of 21 AWS across the entire Greenland Ice Sheet reveals that almost half suffer from this bias, including some AWS located within the wet snow zone.},

For the last glacial period, ice core studies(1,2) have revealed strong coupling of the largest millennial-scale warm events in Antarctica with the longest Dansgaard - Oeschger events in Greenland(3-5) through the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(6-8). It has been unclear, however, whether the shorter Dansgaard - Oeschger events have counterparts in the shorter and less prominent Antarctic temperature variations, and whether these events are linked by the same mechanism. Here we present a glacial climate record derived from an ice core from Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, which represents South Atlantic climate at a resolution comparable with the Greenland ice core records. After methane synchronization with an ice core from North Greenland(9), the oxygen isotope record from the Dronning Maud Land ice core shows a one-to-one coupling between all Antarctic warm events and Greenland Dansgaard - Oeschger events by the bipolar seesaw(6). The amplitude of the Antarctic warm events is found to be linearly dependent on the duration of the concurrent stadial in the North, suggesting that they all result from a similar reduction in the meridional overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {Microplastics have recently been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, and even remote areas far away from source regions of microplastics, suggesting the potential long-distance atmospheric transport for microplastics. There still exist questions regarding the occurrence, fate, transport, and effect of atmospheric microplastics. These questions arise due to limited physical analysis and understanding of atmospheric microplastic pollution in conjunction with a lack of standardized sampling and identification methods. This paper reviews the current status of knowledge on atmospheric microplastics, the methods for sample collection, analysis and detection. We review and compare the methods used in the previous studies and provide recommendations for atmospheric microplastic sampling and measurement. Furthermore, we summarize the findings related to atmospheric microplastic characteristics, including abundance, size, shapes, colours, and polymer types. Microplastics occur in the atmosphere from urban to remote areas, with an abundance/deposition spanning 1--3 orders of magnitude across different sites. Fibres and fragments are the most frequently reported shapes and the types of plastic which generally aligns with world plastic demand. We conclude that atmospheric microplastics require further research and greater understanding to identify its global distributions and potential exposure to human health through further field sampling and implementation of standardized analytical protocols.},

Here, we present global simulations of atmospheric transport of microplastic particles produced by road traffic (TWPs -- tire wear particles and BWPs -- brake wear particles), a major source that can be quantified relatively well. We find a high transport efficiencies of these particles to remote regions. About 34\% of the emitted coarse TWPs and 30\% of the emitted coarse BWPs (100 kt yr-1 and 40 kt yr-1 respectively) were deposited in the World Ocean. These amounts are of similar magnitude as the total estimated direct and riverine transport of TWPs and fibres to the ocean (64 kt yr-1). We suggest that the Arctic may be a particularly sensitive receptor region, where the light-absorbing properties of TWPs and BWPs may also cause accelerated warming and melting of the cryosphere.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago ( Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long - 28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

	abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Accurate measurements of turbulence statistics in the atmosphere are important for eddy-covariance measurements, wind energy research, and the validation of atmospheric numerical models. Sonic anemometers are widely used for these applications. However, these instruments are prone to probe-induced flow distortion effects, and the magnitude of the resulting errors has been debated due to the lack of an absolute reference instrument under field conditions. Here, we present the results of an intercomparison experiment between a CSAT3B sonic anemometer and a high-resolution bistatic Doppler lidar, which is inherently free of any flow distortion. This novel remote sensing instrument has otherwise very similar spatial and temporal sampling characteristics to the sonic anemometer and hence served as a reference for this comparison. The presented measurements were carried out over flat homogeneous terrain at a measurement height of 30\&thinsp;<span class="inline-formula">m</span>. We provide a comparative statistical analysis of the resulting mean wind velocities, the standard deviations of the vertical wind speed and the friction velocity and investigate the reasons for the observed deviations based on the turbulence spectra and co-spectra. Our results show an agreement of the mean wind velocity measurements and the standard deviations of the vertical wind speed with a comparability of 0.082 and 0.020\&thinsp;<span class="inline-formula">m s<sup>-1</sup></span>, respectively. Biases for these two quantities were 0.003 and 0.012\&thinsp;<span class="inline-formula">m s<sup>-1</sup></span>, respectively. Slightly larger differences were observed for friction velocity. Analysis of the corresponding co-spectra showed that the CSAT3B underestimates this quantity systematically by about 3\&thinsp;\% on average as a result of co-spectral losses in the frequency range between 0.1 and 5\&thinsp;<span class="inline-formula">s<sup>-1</sup></span>. We also found that an angle-of-attack-dependent transducer-shadowing correction does not improve the agreement between the CSAT3B and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) lidar effectively.</p>},

These are likely to have a great impact on the mass balance of the ice sheet because of their low albedo. We report annual and geographical variations in the bare ice and dark ice areas that appeared on the Greenland Ice Sheet from 2000 to 2014 by using MODIS satellite images. The July monthly mean of the extent of bare ice showed a positive trend over these 15 years, and large annual variability ranging from 89,975 to 279,075 km<sup>2</sup>, 5 and 16\% of the entire ice sheet, respectively. The extent of dark ice also showed a positive trend and varied annually, ranging from 3575 to 26,975 km<sup>2</sup>, 4 and 10\% of the bare ice extent. These areas are geographically varied, and their expansion is the greatest on the western side, particularly the southwestern side of the ice sheet. The bare ice extent correlates strongly with the monthly mean air temperature in July, suggesting that the extent was determined by snow melt. The dark ice extent also correlates with the air temperature; however, the correlation is weaker. The dark ice extent further correlates negatively with solar radiation. This suggests that the extent of dark ice is not only controlled by snow melt on the ice, but also by changes in the surface structures of the bare ice surface, such as cryoconite holes, which are associated with impurities appearing on the ice surface.},

An air mass backward-trajectory analysis indicates that eastern Canada is likely the primary source region of the biomass burning tracers. Comparisons of levoglucosan and dehydroabietic acid data in the SE-Dome ice core and area burned (vegetation fire) events in Canada suggests that the biomass burning tracers in the ice core document most of the pronounced biomass burning events in eastern Canada over the past several decades, confirming that analyses of biomass burning molecular tracers in Greenland ice cores are useful to reconstruct the frequency of significant biomass burning events in a local region. However, our study also highlights that the wind pattern when the biomass burning occurs is decisive for the registration of a biomass burning event in an ice core even though long-term changes in the wind regime associated with decadal-scale climate oscillations do not significantly influence the transport and deposition of biomass burning tracers on the Greenland ice sheet.},

The model equations are similar for MMM and CWE, but there are significant differences in the objectives and approaches. Complete synthesis of these models is still premature and computational burdens are enormous. Appropriate procedures for joining these models have not been established yet and measurement data required for verification is limited.For convenience in presentations and discussions, coupling methods are divided into four groups: (1) coupling MMM and CWE models for up-scaling or downscaling, (2) up-scaling a CWE model to include the mesoscale meteorological influences, (3) downscaling an MMM to include the CWE capabilities, and (4) a combination of the above three approaches. Mochida et al. (this issue) focuses on up-scaling CWE from an engineering point of view and the present paper focuses on downscaling MMM from a meteorological point of view. Topics addressed here are (1) to understand the differences in the purposes and approaches of MMM and CWE models and (2) to identify issues and explore ways of coupling MMM and CWE modeling capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The assumed increase of the mean annual air temperature above the ice covers a range from Delta T = 1 degrees C to 12 degrees C, and several parameterizations for the snowfall and the surface melting are considered. The simulated shrinking of the ice sheet is a smooth function of the temperature rise, indications for the existence of critical thresholds of the climate input are not found. Within 1000 model years, the ice-volume decrease is limited to 10\% of the present volume for Delta T less than or equal to 3 degrees C, whereas the most extreme scenario, Delta T = 12 degrees C, leads to an almost entire disintegration, which corresponds to a sea-level equivalent of 7 m. The different snowfall and melting parameterizations yield an uncertainty range of up to 20\% of the present ice volume after 1000 model years.},

We find that following an initial decrease in the extent of the firn area (2003-04), the firn line lowered within two subsequent years by similar to 40-100m elevation in the north and west and 150-230m in the south and east of the ice cap, corresponding to a lateral expansion of the firn area along the profiles by up to 7.3 and 13.3 km, respectively.

The aim was to study the annual layering in the upper 50 m of the snowpack and to compare the results obtained by three radar antenna frequencies (50, 100 and 800 MHz). Intercomparison of the radar profiles measured by the three frequencies shows that some individual internal layers are visible with different antennas. Sparse accumulation-rate data from stake measurements and snow pits are compared with layer depths. The comparison reveals a great deal of scatter due to the large interannual variability in accumulation patterns. Using the radar layers as isochrones together with a model of depth-density-radar-wave velocity allows the individual accumulation data to be integrated, and a better estimate of accumulation patterns is obtained. Using the radar layering seems to be a much better method of estimating accumulation rate in this region than using a short series of stake measurements, even In the absence of deep ice cores to directly date the radar layering.},

We show that long-range transport from eastern Asian deserts provides mineral dust with essentially the same composition to all elevated interior sites (Dye 3, Site A, GRIP, and NorthGRIP), while most material deposited at sites located closer to the edge and at lower altitude (Hans Tausen and Renland) derives from proximal source regions. No contribution from other sources is apparent at any of the interior sites from the mineralogical and isotopic composition of the dust samples, each of which represents several decades of dust deposition during the 17th-18th century. These results provide additional evidence that African and North American deserts do not play a significant role in the dust deposited over Greenland, which has implications for ice core record interpretation and atmospheric dust transport model validation.},

Empirical equations calculate sediment erosion and deposition within a constant idealized glacier drainage system. The sediment model is forced by observations and an energy balance model based on meteorological observations that provide a simulated Surface Melt and liquid Precipitation available for supra-, en-, sub-, and proglacial flow processes after vertical percolation and potential storage within the snowpack (henceforth SMP) from the glacier surface which is available for subglacial erosion, glaciofluvial transport, and deposition within the drainage system. The idealized drainage system is constrained following the descriptions and conclusions from previous work. A model simulation run for summer 2005 shows that the cumulative modeled suspended sediment transport lies within 3\% when compared with observations. Model results show that the temporal changes in the calculated suspended sediment concentrations vary over the melt season in some agreement with measured field data for the summer of 2005. Forcing the sediment model gives a correlation coefficient of 0.89 using observed proglacial meltwater discharge values and the correlation coefficient is 0.63 using modeled supraglacial meltwater runoff. The sediment model successfully captures the observed concentration and transport of suspended sediment which indicates a sufficient sediment reservoir available for transport through the idealized drainage system.},

Recent observations of rapid retreat of ice-shelf grounding lines in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica have highlighted the need for understanding how basal melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters affects ice dynamics and potentially contributes indirectly to sea-level rise. We apply two ice stream-ice shelf flow line models to investigate the effects of varying the spatial distribution of basal melting on grounding-line dynamics. For experiments with identical average melting, we find that retreat increases significantly as melting is concentrated near the grounding line, indicating that knowledge of the basal-melting distribution is likely necessary for accurate prediction of grounding-line migration.},

	abstract = {In order to fulfill the society demand for climate information at the spatial scale allowing impact studies, long-term high-resolution climate simulations are produced, over an area covering metropolitan France. One of the major goals of this article is to investigate whether such simulations appropriately simulate the spatial and temporal variability of the current climate, using two simulation chains. These start from the global IPSL-CM4 climate model, using two regional models (LMDz and MM5) at moderate resolution (15-20 km), followed with a statistical downscaling method in order to reach a target resolution of 8 km. The statistical downscaling technique includes a non-parametric method that corrects the distribution by using high-resolution analyses over France. First the uncorrected simulations are evaluated against a set of high-resolution analyses, with a focus on temperature and precipitation. Uncorrected downscaled temperatures suffer from a cold bias that is present in the global model as well. Precipitations biases have a season- and model-dependent behavior. Dynamical models overestimate rainfall but with different patterns and amplitude, but both have underestimations in the South-Eastern area (Cevennes mountains) in winter. A variance decomposition shows that uncorrected simulations fairly well capture observed variances from inter-annual to high-frequency intra-seasonal time scales. After correction, distributions match with analyses by construction, but it is shown that spatial coherence, persistence properties of warm, cold and dry episodes also match to a certain extent. Another aim of the article is to describe the changes for future climate obtained using these simulations under Scenario A1B. Results are presented on the changes between current and mid-term future (2021-2050) averages and variability over France. Interestingly, even though the same global climate model is used at the boundaries, regional climate change responses from the two models significantly differ. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	author = {Harrison, S P and Kohfeld, K E and Roelandt, C and Claquin, T},
	year = {2001},
	abstract = {Natural mineral aerosol (dust) is an active component of the climate system and plays multiple roles in mediating physical and biogeochemical exchanges between the atmosphere, land surface and ocean. Changes in the amount of dust in the atmosphere are caused both by changes in climate (precipitation, wind strength, regional moisture balance) and changes in the extent of dust sources caused by either anthropogenic or climatically induced changes in vegetation cover. Models of the global dust cycle take into account the physical controls on dust deflation from prescribed source areas (based largely on soil wetness and vegetation cover thresholds), dust transport within the atmospheric column, and dust deposition through sedimentation and scavenging by precipitation. These models successfully reproduce the first-order spatial and temporal patterns in atmospheric dust loading under modem conditions.Atmospheric dust loading was as much as an order-of-magnitude larger than today during the last glacial maximum (LGM). While the observed increase in emissions from northern Africa can be explained solely in terms of climate changes (colder, drier and windier glacial climates), increased emissions from other regions appear to have been largely a response to climatically induced changes in vegetation cover and hence in the extent of dust source areas. Model experiments suggest that the increased dust loading in tropical regions had an effect on radiative forcing comparable to that of low glacial CO2 levels.Changes in land-use are already increasing the dust loading of the atmosphere. However, simulations show that anthropogenically forced climate changes substantially reduce the extent and productivity of natural dust sources. Positive feedbacks initiated by a reduction of dust emissions from natural source areas on both radiative forcing and atmospheric CO2 could substantially mitigate the impacts of land-use changes, and need to be considered in climate change assessments.

A large amount of available information is often excluded from the analysis because it is acquired at stations that do not respect completely the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards, so that their corresponding collected data could be unreliable for wind energy purposes. However, even if they are distorted by surrounding elements, these abundant data processed as a whole could be an important source of wind measurements. The present work tests the usefulness of the information provided by a group of basic meteorological stations focused on agricultural monitoring. This is done using a simple linear model which extracts a regional wind description from the real measurements. The validation is performed by contrasting with two advanced numerical estimations of the wind climate in the area. The visual and numerical comparison among the estimations shows that basic stations could be considered an interesting source of information, able to help in many wind areas, but also able to supply models specifically designed to work with this kind of data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to simulate and reconstruct annual glacier-wide surface mass balance (SMB) series based on a deep artificial neural network (ANN; i.e. deep learning). This method has been included as the SMB component of an open-source regional glacier evolution model. While most glacier models tend to incorporate more and more physical processes, here we take an alternative approach by creating a parameterized model based on data science. Annual glacier-wide SMBs can be simulated from topo-climatic predictors using either deep learning or Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; regularized multilinear regression), whereas the glacier geometry is updated using a glacier-specific parameterization. We compare and cross-validate our nonlinear deep learning SMB model against other standard linear statistical methods on a dataset of 32 French Alpine glaciers. Deep learning is found to outperform linear methods, with improved explained variance (up to C 64 \% in space and C108 \% in time) and accuracy (up to C47 \% in space and C58 \% in time), resulting in an estimated r2 of 0.77 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 m w.e. Substantial nonlinear structures are captured by deep learning, with around 35 \% of nonlinear behaviour in the temporal dimension. For the glacier geometry evolution, the main uncertainties come from the ice thickness data used to initialize the model. These results should encourage the use of deep learning in glacier modelling as a powerful nonlinear tool, capable of capturing the nonlinearities of the climate and glacier systems, that can serve to reconstruct or simulate SMB time series for individual glaciers in a whole region for past and future climates.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for wind characterization and mapping by using an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The generation of a wind map is vital in energy-efficient trajectory planning of efficient trajectories and dynamic soaring applications to detect the shear layer. Firstly, two methods to estimate the parameters that define an unknown wind field (wind speed and direction) by using a UAS are analyzed. The best method is selected by fitting the estimated wind data into a Weibull probability density function. The obtained Weibull parameters are used to extrapolate the data into a finite grid. Then an extrapolation method based on the so-called Weibull extrapolation Method (WM) is proposed. The implemented extrapolation method presents two advantages: it works with measurements at different heights and considers a significant noise component of the measurements. This break-through allows the possibility of real-time construction of a wind map, which is imperative for accurate trajectory planning and wind feature detection, such as gusts, shear wind or turbulence. Real telemetry data have been used in order to implement the method. Once the extrapolated data are obtained, an analysis is performed to validate the data by determining if the selected data continues fitting into a Weibull distribution and follows the Empirical Power Law (EPL).},

The effects of numerically computed divergence and trajectories on the results were also investigated. Random small-scale errors due to the divergence, especially with realistic winds, can be observed. The total mass is conserved, however, and is not affected since the results show clearly that SLICE ensures a perfect local conservation.

A highly detailed and continuous delta(18)O profile has thus been obtained and is discussed in terms of past temperatures in Greenland. We also discuss a three-core stacked annual delta(18)O profile for the past 917 years. The short-term (<50 years) variability of the annual delta(18)O signal is found to be 1 parts per thousand in the Holocene, and estimates for the coldest parts of the last glacial are 3 parts per thousand or higher. These data also provide insights into possible disturbances of the stratigraphic layering in the core which seems to be sound down to the onset of the Eemian. Spectral analysis of highly detailed sequences of the profile helps determine the smoothing of the delta(18)O signal, which for the Holocene ice is found to be considerably stronger than expected. We suggest this is due to a process involving diffusion of water molecules along crystal boundaries in the recrystallizing ice matrix. Deconvolution techniques were employed for restoring with great confidence the highly attenuated annual delta(18)O signal in the Holocene. We confirm earlier findings of dramatic temperature changes in Greenland during the last glacial cycle. Abrupt and strong climatic shifts are also found within the Eem/Sangamon Interglaciation, which is normally recorded as a period of warm and stable climate in lower latitudes. The stratigraphic continuity of the Eemian layers is consequently discussed in section 3 of this paper in terms of all pertinent data which we are not able to reconcile.},

Here, we perform the first-ever glacier evolution projections based on deep learning by modelling the 21st century glacier evolution in the French Alps. By the end of the century, we predict a glacier volume loss between 75 and 88\%. Deep learning captures a nonlinear response of glaciers to air temperature and precipitation, improving the representation of extreme mass balance rates compared to linear statistical and temperature-index models. Our results confirm an over-sensitivity of temperature-index models, often used by large-scale studies, to future warming. We argue that such models can be suitable for steep mountain glaciers. However, glacier projections under low-emission scenarios and the behaviour of flatter glaciers and ice caps are likely to be biased by mass balance models with linear sensitivities, introducing long-term biases in sea-level rise and water resources projections.},

An earlier study in the Vienna area comparing practically all measurement methods in use in Europe gave comparable BC and EC concentrations under summer conditions (Hitzenberger et al., 2006a). Under summer conditions, Diesel traffic is the major source for EC or BC in Vienna. Under winter conditions, space heating (also with biomass as fuel) is another important source (Caseiro et al., 2007). The present study compares the response of thermal methods (a modified Cachier method, Cachier et al., 1989; a thermal-optical method, Schmid et al., 2001; and two thermal-optical (TOT) methods using Sunset instruments, Birch and Cary, 1996 and Schauer et al., 2003) and optical methods (a light transmission method, Hansen et al., 1984; the integrating sphere method, Hitzenberger et al., 1996; and the multiangle absorption photometer MAAP, Petzold and Sch{\"{o}}nlinner, 2004).

We use a numerical ice-flow model that captures the major aspects of the glacier's mass budget, the resistive forces controlling glacier flow, and includes dynamic calving. Satellite observations and model results show that the recent break-off of 25\% of the floating tongue did not result in a significant glacier speed-up due to the low lateral resistance of this relatively wide and thin ice tongue. We demonstrate that seasonal speed-up at Petermann Glacier is mainly driven by meltwater lubrication rather than freeze-up conditions in the fjord. Results also show that sub-shelf ocean melt may have a profound effect on the future stability of Petermann Glacier, emphasizing the urgent need for more observations, and a better understanding of fjord temperature variability and circulation.},

	abstract = {As a wind turbine generates power, induced velocities, lower than the freestream velocity, will be present upstream of the turbine due to perturbation of the flow by the rotor. In this study, the upstream induction zone of a 225\hspace{0.167em}kW horizontal axis Vestas V27 wind turbine located at the Danish Technical University's Ris{\o} campus is investigated using a scanning Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) system. Three short-range continuous-wave ``WindScanner'' lidars are positioned in the field around the V27 turbine allowing detection of all three components of the wind velocity vectors within the induction zone. The time-averaged mean wind speeds at different locations in the upstream induction zone are measured by scanning a horizontal plane at hub height and a vertical plane centered at the middle of the rotor extending roughly 1.5 rotor diameters (D) upstream of the rotor. Turbulence statistics in the induction zone are studied by more rapidly scanning along individual lines perpendicular to the rotor at different radial distances from the hub. The mean velocity measurements reveal that the longitudinal velocity reductions become greater closer to the rotor plane and closer to the center of the rotor. Velocity deficits of 1\%--3\% of the freestream value were observed 1 D upstream of the rotor, increasing at the rotor plane to 7.4\% near the edge of the rotor and 18\% near the center of the rotor while the turbine was operating with a high estimated mechanical coefficient of power (CP) of 0.56 yielding an estimated axial induction factor of 0.25. The velocity reductions relative to the freestream velocity become smaller when the turbine's coefficient of power decreases; for a low CP of 0.16 resulting in an estimated induction factor of 0.04, the velocity deficits are \sim{}1\% of the freestream value 1 D upstream of the rotor and only 6\% at the rotor plane near the center of the rotor. Additionally, the mean radial wind speeds were found to increase close to the edge of the rotor disk indicating an expansion of the incoming flow around the rotor. Radial velocity magnitudes at the edge of the rotor disk of approximately 9\% and 3\% of the freestream longitudinal wind speed were measured for the abovementioned high and low CP values, respectively. Turbulence statistics, calculated using 2.5-min time series, suggest that the standard deviation of the longitudinal wind component decreases close to the rotor, while the standard deviation of the radial wind component appears to increase. When the turbine was operating with a high CP of 0.54 resulting in an estimated induction factor of 0.22, standard deviation decreases of up to 22\% of the estimated freestream value and increases of up to 46\% were observed for the longitudinal and radial components, respectively, near the center of the rotor.},

	abstract = {The advanced very high resolution radiometer Polar Pathfinder (APP) data set is used to examine the variability of the surface albedo over Greenland. Analysis of the APP albedo record from 1981 to 1998 show anomalously low albedo during 1995 and 1998 over most of the ice sheet as compared with the other years. The low albedo encountered during these years suggests that the ice sheet experienced considerable melt in 1995 and 1998, particularly near the western margin of the ice sheet. Conversely, anomalously high albedos were found in 1992 as a result of colder temperatures and hence less melt following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The relationship between the annual North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and the mean summer albedo from all the stations reveals a positive correlation of 0.44 and a positive correlation of 0.55 for die southern part of the ice sheet. Therefore variations in the mean summer albedo over Greenland can, in part, be explained by variations in the NAO sucl. that during periods of intensification of the normal mode of the NAO the mean summer albedo is above normal. Trend analysis reveals an overall downward trend in surface albedo from 1981 to 1998, which agrees with recent trends in melt and precipitation. However, the trend was found not to be statistically significant but rather influenced by the low albedo in recent years.},

	abstract = {The phosphorus (P) cycle is an important Earth system process. While natural P mobilization is slow, humans have been altering P cycle by intensifying P releases from lithosphere to ecosystems. Here, we examined magnitudes of which humans have altered the P cycles by integrating the estimates from recent literatures, and furthermore illustrated the consequences. Based on our synthesis, human alterations have tripled the global P mobilization in land-water continuum and increased P accumulation in soil with 6.9 $\pm$ 3.3 Tg-P yr-1. Around 30\% of atmospheric P transfer is caused by human activities, which plays a significant role than previously thought. Pathways involving with human alterations include phosphate extraction, fertilizers application, wastes generation, and P losses from cropland. This study highlights the importance of sustainable P supply as a control on future food security because of regional P scarcity, food demand increase and continuously P intensive food production. Besides, accelerated P loads are responsible for enhanced eutrophication worldwide, resulting in water quality impairment and aquatic biodiversity losses. Moreover, the P enrichment can definitely stimulate the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, implying the great need for incorporating P in models predicting the response of carbon and nitrogen cycles to global changes.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a local tricubic interpolation scheme in three dimensions that is both C-1 and isotropic. The algorithm is based on a specific 64 x 64 matrix that gives the relationship between the derivatives at the corners of the elements and the coefficients of the tricubic interpolant for this element. In contrast with global interpolation where the interpolated function usually depends on the whole data sit, our tricubic local interpolation only uses data in a neighbourhood of an element. We show that the resulting interpolated function and its three first derivatives are continuous if one uses cubic interpolants. The implementation of the interpolator can be downloaded as a static and dynamic library for most platforms. The major difference between this work and current local interpolation schemes is that we do not separate the problem into three one-dimensional problems. This allows for a much easier and accurate computation of higher derivatives of the extrapolated field. Applications to the computation of Lagrangian coherent structures in ocean data are briefly discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Drones are one of the most intensively studied technologies in logistics in recent years. They combine technological features matching current trends in transport industry and society like autonomy, flexibility, and agility. Among the various concepts for using drones in logistics, parcel delivery is one of the most popular application scenarios. Companies like Amazon test drones particularly for last-mile delivery intending to achieve both reducing total cost and increasing customer satisfaction by fast deliveries. As drones are electric vehicles, they are also often claimed to be an eco-friendly mean of transportation. In this paper an energy consumption model for drones is proposed to describe the energy demand for drone deliveries depending on environmental conditions and the flight pattern. The model is used to simulate the energy demand of a stationary parcel delivery system which serves a set customers from a depot. The energy consumed by drones is compared to the energy demand of Diesel trucks and electric trucks serving the same customers from the same depot. The results indicate that switching to a solely drone-based parcel delivery system is not worthwhile from an energetic perspective in most scenarios. A stationary drone-based parcel delivery system requires more energy than a truck-based parcel delivery system particularly in urban areas where customer density is high and truck tours are comparatively short. In rather rural settings with long distances between customers, a drone-based parcel delivery system creates an energy demand comparable to a parcel delivery system with electric trucks provided environmental conditions are moderate.},

	journal = {Earth-Science Reviews},
	doi = {10.1016/j.earscirev.2007.02.002},
	abstract = {Calving of icebergs is an important component of mass loss from the polar ice sheets and glaciers in many parts of the world. Calving rates can increase dramatically in response to increases in velocity and/or retreat of the glacier margin, with important implications for sea level change. Despite their importance, calving and related dynamic processes are poorly represented in the current generation of ice sheet models. This is largely because understanding the 'calving problem' involves several other long-standing problems in glaciology, combined with the difficulties and dangers of field data collection. In this paper, we systematically review different aspects of the calving problem, and outline a new framework for representing calving processes in ice sheet models. We define a hierarchy of calving processes, to distinguish those that exert a fundamental control on the position of the ice margin from more localised processes responsible for individual calving events. The first-order control on calving is the strain rate arising from spatial variations in velocity (particularly sliding speed), which determines the location and depth of surface crevasses. Superimposed on this first-order process are second-order processes that can further erode the ice margin. These include: fracture propagation in response to local stress imbalances in the immediate vicinity of the glacier front; undercutting of the glacier terminus by melting at or below the waterline; and bending at the junction between grounded and buoyant parts of an ice tongue. Calving of projecting, submerged 'ice feet' can be regarded as a third-order process, because it is paced by first- or second-order calving above the waterline.First-order calving can be represented in glacier models using a calving criterion based on crevasse depth, which is a function of longitudinal strain rate. Modelling changes in terminus position and calving rates thus reduces to the problem of determining the ice geometry and velocity distribution. Realistic solutions to the problem of modelling ice flow therefore depend critically on an appropriate choice of sliding law. Models that assume that basal velocities are controlled by basal drag can replicate much of the observed behaviour of calving glaciers with grounded termini, but an important limitation is that they cannot be used to model floating glacier termini or ice shelves. Alternative sliding laws that parameterise drag from the glacier margins provide more flexible and robust ways of representing calving in ice sheet models. Such models can explain a remarkable range of observed phenomena within a simple, unifying framework, including: downglacier increases in velocity and strain rates where basal and/or lateral drag diminishes; flow acceleration in response to thinning through time; the tendency for glaciers to stabilise at 'pinning points' in relatively shallow water or fjord narrowings; the constraints on ice shelf stability; and the contrasts in calving rates between tidewater and freshwater calving glaciers. Many unresolved issues remain, however, including the role played by the removal of backstress in the acceleration of retreating calving glaciers, and the controls on melting at and below the waterline.

The ice core stratigraphy is clearly visible throughout the glacial period with the most frequent and brightest visible layers appearing during the coldest events. Down to a depth of 2600 m the horizontal layering is very regular; below this depth, small irregularities in the layering start to appear, and below 2800 m the visual stratigraphy becomes more uncertain, perhaps because of penetration into climatically warmer ice. Comparison of the visual stratigraphy with high- resolution continuous records of chemical impurities and dust reveals a high degree of correlation, which indicates that the visible layers are caused by these impurities. A new approach is used to automatically determine annual layer thicknesses from the visual stratigraphy record by carrying out a frequency analysis of the most prominent visible layers in the profile. The result gives strong support for the NorthGRIP timescale model.},

The model simulates key characteristics, such as control on the size of ice sheets through the advection of moisture, asymmetric ice sheets due to advection of moisture and orography, and the drying of ice sheets when they grow. A simulation of the Eurasian Ice Sheet through a full glacial cycle shows that the model reproduces realistic ice sheets that compare well with geomorphological data. During the Middle Weichselian and the Late Weichselian, the model picks up the trend that the Scandinavian part of the ice grows towards the south and east whilst the ice sheet covering the Barents and Kara Seas remains relatively stable. However, the model seriously underestimates the observed ice extent in the Baltic area. Uncertainties in the temperature and the wind field limit the reliability of regional modelling results.

	abstract = {The 2537-m-deep North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) core provided a first-time opportunity to perform extensive microbiological analyses on selected, recently drilled ice core samples representing different depths, ages, ice structures, deposition climates and ionic compositions. Here, we applied cultivation, small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene clone library construction and Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeting the V4V5 region, to examine the microbial abundance, viability and diversity in five decontaminated NEEM samples from selected depths (101.2, 633.05, 643.5, 1729.75 and 2051.5 m) deposited 30080\hphantom{,}000 years ago. These comparisons of the indigenous glacial microbial populations in the ice samples detected significant spatial and temporal variations. Major findings include: (a) different phylogenetic diversity of isolates, dominated by Actinobacteria and fungi, compared to the culture-independent diversity, in which Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were more frequent; (b) cultivation of a novel alphaproteobacterium; (c) dominance of Cyanobacteria among the SSU rRNA gene clones from the 1729.75-m ice; (d) identification of Archaea by NGS that are rarely detected in glacial ice; (e) detection of one or two dominant but different genera among the NGS sequences from each sample; (f) finding dominance of Planococcaceae over Bacillaceae among Firmicutes in the brittle and the 2051.5-m ice. The overall beta diversity between the studied ice core samples examined at the phylum/class level for each approach showed that the population structure of the brittle ice was significantly different from the two deep clathrated ice samples and the shallow ice core.

The general solution to address this well-known problem is the design of a platform with some degree of reconfigurable airframes. For critical missions (civilian or military), it is imperative that mechanical complexity is kept to a minimum to help achieve mission success. This work proposes that the tried-and-true radio controlled (RC) aerobatic airplanes can be implemented as basis for fixed-wing UAVs having both speed and vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. These powerful and highly maneuverable airplanes have non-rotatable nacelles, yet capable of deep stall maneuvers. The power requirements for VTOL and level flight of an aerobatic RC airplane are evaluated and they are compared to those of a RC helicopter of similar flying weight. This work provides quantitative validation that commercially available RC aerobatic airplanes can serve as platform to build VTOL capable fixed-wing UAVs that are agile, cost effective, reliable and easy maintenance.},

	author = {Huybrechts, Philippe and de Wolde, J},
	year = {1999},
	abstract = {New calculations were performed to investigate the combined response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to a range of climatic warming scenarios over the next millennium. Use was made of fully dynamic 3D thermomechanic ice sheet models, which were coupled to a two-dimensional climate model. The experiments were initialized with simulations over the last two glacial cycles to estimate the present evolution and were subsequently forced with temperature scenarios resulting from greenhouse emission scenarios which assume equivalent CO2 increases of two, four, and eight times the present (1990 A.D.) value by the year 2130 A.D. and a stabilization after that. The calculations brought to light that during the next century (short-term effect), the background evolution trend would dominate the response of the Antarctic ice sheet but would be negligible for the Greenland ice sheet. On that timescale, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets would roughly balance one another for the middle scenario (similar to the IPCC96 IS92a scenario), with respective contributions to the worldwide sea level stand on the order of about 􏰔10 cm. On the longer term, however, both ice sheets would contribute positively to the worldwide sea level stand and the most important effect would come from melting on the Greenland ice sheet. Sensitivity experiments highlighted the role of ice dynamics and the heightmass- balance feedback on the results. It was found that ice dynamics cannot be neglected for the Greenland ice sheet, not even on a century timescale, but becomes only important for Antarctica on the longer term. The latter is related to an increased outflow of ice into the ice shelves and to the grounding-line retreat of the west Antarctic ice sheet, which are both found to be sensitive to basal melting below ice shelves and the effective viscosity of the ice shelves. Stretching parameters to their limits yielded a combined maximum rate of sea level rise of 85 cm century􏰑1, of which 60 cm would originate from the Greenland ice sheet alone},

The system is shown to be able to perform wind-speed measurements even in clear atmospheric conditions when the visibility exceeds 40 km. The aerosol measurements indicate the potential to use single-particle detection for wind measurements with enhanced sensitivity. The system can perform range and line-of-sight velocity measurements of hard targets at ranges of the order of several kilometers with a range accuracy of a few meters and a velocity accuracy of 0.1 m/s by use of triangular-wave frequency modulation with compensation of the frequency-modulation response of the semiconductor laser. The system also demonstrates a capability for vibration sensing.},

	abstract = {In this study, we identify a new mechanism by which dust aerosols travel over long distances across the eastern side of the North Atlantic Ocean toward the Arctic. The meandering polar jet was at the origin of both dust emission through cyclogenesis over Northwest Africa and poleward transport of the uplifted dust towards the Arctic, through cutoff circulation. The dust emission was associated with an intense Saharan cyclone that formed over Northwest Africa in early April 2011. The formation of the cyclone was caused by the intrusion into subtropics, of a high-latitude-upper-level trough, linked to the meandering polar jet. The trough initiated cyclogenesis over Northwest Africa after orographic blocking by the Anti-Atlas Mountains. The still meandering polar jet led to the formation of a cutoff low further south with which the Saharan dust-cyclone merged 2 d later and moved northward with the main stream. Beside satellite observations, a simulation at high resolution was performed using the prognostic-dust permitting model MesoNH. The total dust load carried during this event to areas located north of 40 \textasteriskcentered N was estimated by the model to be 38 Tg and dust deposition was estimated to be 1.3 Tg. The Saharan dust reaching Greenland was accompanied by warm and moist air masses that caused a rise in surface temperature of about 10 \textasteriskcentered C for more than 3 consecutive days over the southeastern Greenland. Ice melt over this area of Greenland was detected in the brightness temperature observations.},

The SLICE scheme is based on a control-volume approach that uses multiple sweeps of a one-dimensional 0 (Delta x(4)) conservation remapping algorithm along predetermined cascade directions. The new filter combines a selective detection algorithm, to pinpoint regions of non-monotonic behaviour, with a hierarchical reduction of the degree of the piecewise reconstruction in such regions, to re-establish monotonicity. The enhanced, monotonic and positive-definite, SLICE scheme is tested in one dimension, and then applied to standard two-dimensional test problems in both Cartesian and spherical geometries. Comparisons with published results of other conservative semi-Lagrangian schemes show that it performs well.},

The present paper proposes a regional wind monitoring system based on the integration of different meteorological nets as a direct way to obtain this information. Concretely, we describe a monitoring system for the region of Andalusia supported by 198 stations, able to provide near surface wind field estimations with updating period of 10. min. Each of these stations has different characteristics since they are focused on measuring different environmental parameters, and most of them are below the quality level required by the World Meteorological Organization for wind measurement. Despite this drawback, the proposed monitoring system takes advantage of the high density of measurement points to produce valuable descriptions of the regional wind field. A basic geostatistical model coupled to the system achieves better results than Numerical Weather Prediction models, obtaining RMSE values of 1.52. m/s and 64.9$\,^{\circ}$ for speed and directional series respectively. The test confirms the tolerance of this massive monitoring system to data without quality assurance, being an interesting platform to implement crowdsourcing methodologies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Present-day land surface models rarely account for the influence of both black carbon and dust in the snow on the snow albedo. Snow impurities increase the absorption of incoming shortwave radiation (particularly in the visible bands), whereby they have major consequences for the evolution of snowmelt and life cycles of snowpack. A new parameterization of these snow impurities was included in the catchment-based land surface model used in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Earth Observing System version 5. Validation tests against in situ observed data were performed for the winter of 2003-2004 in Sapporo, Japan, for both the new snow albedo parameterization (which explicitly accounts for snow impurities) and the preexisting baseline albedo parameterization (which does not). Validation tests reveal that daily variations of snow depth and snow surface albedo are more realistically simulated with the new parameterization. Reasonable perturbations in the assigned snow impurity concentrations, as inferred from the observational data, produce significant changes in snowpack depth and radiative flux interactions. These findings illustrate the importance of parameterizing the influence of snow impurities on the snow surface albedo for proper simulation of the life cycle of snow cover.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope studies of surface ice and water samples collected in the ablation zone of the Greenland ice-sheet margin at Paakitsup Akuliarusersua approximately 40 km northeast of Ilulissat/Jakobshavn, West Greenland, show that there is a large systematic spatial variation of the O-18/O-16 ratio (deltaO-18) over the ablation area. DeltaO-18 can, therefore, be used as a natural tracer to locate the origin of the melt-water runoff. A simple model is set up for simulating the deltaO-18 variation in the melt-water discharge from the area. Simulations are made with a drainage basin obtained by modelling the subglacial drainage conditions, which requires costly and time-consuming mapping of the subglacial topography. The simulated delta-values agree well with observed delta-values of water samples from three pro-glacial lakes which receive the melt-water discharge. This suggests that the stable isotope method can be used to give an initial estimate of melt-water drainage-basin boundaries on the Greenland ice-sheet margin.},

	abstract = {A simple numerical flow model that couples mass divergence directly to basal shear stress as the only driving force is used to study kinematic waves. Kinematic waves that result from a perturbation of the ice thickness or mass balance are compared with the linear kinematic-wave theory of Nye/Weertman. The wave velocity is calculated as a function of the wavelength and amplitude of a perturbation. The modelled wave velocity is typically 6-8 times the vertically averaged velocity in the flow direction whereas linear theory predicts a factor of only 5.An experiment with the geometry of Hintereisferner, Austria, shows that the increase in the local ice velocity during a kinematic wave is about 10\% but varies slightly depending on the position along the glacier and the amplitude of the kinematic wave. Kinematic waves are thus hard to detect from velocity measurements.The dynamics of simple continuity models are rich enough to support a variety of kinematic-wave phenomena. Such models are a useful tool to study the response of valley glaciers to climate change.},

Recently developed calving criteria make use of models which predict crevasse depth from surface strain rates, but these models have rarely been tested against observations. In this study, we present data on crevasse depth and surface strain rates, and compare the measured values with results of two crevasse-depth models: a simple function proposed by Nye and a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) model developed by Van der Veen. Our results indicate that both models predict crevasse depths within the correct order of magnitude. The LEFM model, incorporating measured values of crevasse spacing and tuned for fracture toughness, performs better in predicting crevasse depths, but where lack of input data precludes such tuning, the results are similar to Nye's model predictions. We conclude that both models may be used to calculate crevasse depths in calving models, although the Nye function is undoubtedly much simpler to implement within an ice-dynamics model.},

	abstract = {Cryoconite is a mixture of mineral and organic material covering glacial ice, playing important roles in biogeochemical cycles and lowering the albedo of a glacier surface. Understanding the differences in structure of cryoconite across the globe can be important in recognizing past and future changes in supraglacial environments and ice-organisms-minerals interactions. Despite the worldwide distribution and over a century of studies, the basic characteristics of cryoconite, including its forms and geochemistry, remain poorly studied. The major purpose of our study is the presentation and description of morphological diversity, chemical and photoautotrophs composition, and organic matter content of cryoconite sampled from 33 polar and mountain glaciers around the globe. Observations revealed that cryoconite is represented by various morphologies including loose and granular forms. Granular cryoconite includes smooth, rounded, or irregularly shaped forms; with some having their surfaces covered by cyanobacteria filaments. The occurrence of granules increased with the organic matter content in cryoconite. Moreover, a major driver of cryoconite colouring was the concentration of organic matter and its interplay with minerals. The structure of cyanobacteria and algae communities in cryoconite differs between glaciers, but representatives of cyanobacteria families Pseudanabaenaceae and Phormidiaceae, and algae families Mesotaeniaceae and Ulotrichaceae were the most common. The most of detected cyanobacterial taxa are known to produce polymeric substances (EPS) that may cement granules. Organic matter content in cryoconite varied between glaciers, ranging from 1\% to 38\%. The geochemistry of all the investigated samples reflected local sediment sources, except of highly concentrated Pb and Hg in cryoconite collected from European glaciers near industrialized regions, corroborating cryoconite as element-specific collector and potential environmental indicator of anthropogenic activity. Our work supports a notion that cryoconite may be more than just simple sediment and instead exhibits complex structure with relevance for biodiversity and the functioning of glacial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to simultaneous wind ranging and velocimetry using low peak power, long-duration modulated laser pulse transmissions is proposed. Received signals backscattered by aerosol particles are processed by a multi-reference matched-filter (MRMF) which performs matched filter processing between the received signal and several reference signals in parallel and outputs a range-velocity profile of received power. Ranging and velocimetry are performed simultaneously by estimating received power, radial velocity, and velocity dispersion from a velocity profile at an arbitrary range in the range-velocity profile. The accuracies of the three estimates improve in proportion to the square root of pulse duration; that is, a 100 times longer pulse is equivalent to a 10-dB amplification.},

	abstract = {We describe exact solutions to the thermomechanically coupled shallow-ice approximation in three spatial dimensions. Although artificially constructed, these solutions are very useful for testing numerical methods. In fact, they allow us to verify a finite-difference scheme, that is, to show that the results of our numerical scheme converge to the correct continuum values as the grid is refined in three dimensions. Comparison of numerical results with exact solutions has helped us to precisely quantify and understand some of the numerical errors we are making. Our verified numerical scheme shows the basal temperature spokes which arose in the EISMINT (European Ice Sheet Modelling INiTiative) 11 intercomparison (Payne and others, 2000). A careful analysis describes these warm spokes as numerical errors which occur when the derivative of the strain-heating term with respect to the temperature is large. On the other hand, the appearance of basal temperature spokes in a verified numerical scheme strongly suggests that they are a feature of the EISMINT 11 experiment IF continuum problem. In fact, they are clear evidence of an unstable equilibrium point of the continuum problem. This paper is a sequel to Bueler and others (2005), which addresses exact solutions and verification in the isothermal case.},

This time-extrapolation can lead to instabilities. In the new scheme the second-order accuracy is achieved by means of a Taylor series expansion to second order around the departure point of the semi-Lagrangian trajectory thus avoiding extrapolation of the first-order term. The estimate of the second-order term in this expansion is obtained by means of a stable time extrapolation from the previous time step and therefore the scheme is named the 'Stable Extrapolation Two-Time-Level Scheme' or SETTLS.Some cases of noise in forecast fields. arising from an instability of the time extrapolation in the version of the two-time-level semi-Lagrangian scheme used operationally at the European Centre for Medium-Range weather Forecasts (ECMWF) between December 1996 and April 1998, are diagnosed it is shown that the noise can be removed by the use of the SETTLS.},

	year = {2007},
	journal = {Journal of Geophysical Research},
	doi = {10.1029/2006JD008003},
	abstract = {We apply our Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model, coupled to a general circulation model with prognostic carbon aerosol transport, to improve understanding of climate forcing and response from black carbon (BC) in snow. Building on two previous studies, we account for interannually varying biomass burning BC emissions, snow aging, and aerosol scavenging by snow meltwater. We assess uncertainty in forcing estimates from these factors, as well as BC optical properties and snow cover fraction. BC emissions are the largest source of uncertainty, followed by snow aging. The rate of snow aging determines snowpack effective radius (r e), which directly controls snow reflectance and the magnitude of albedo change caused by BC. For a reasonable r e range, reflectance reduction from BC varies threefold. Inefficient meltwater scavenging keeps hydrophobic impurities near the surface during melt and enhances forcing. Applying biomass burning BC emission inventories for a strong (1998) and weak (2001) boreal fire year, we estimate global annual mean BC/snow surface radiative forcing from all sources (fossil fuel, biofuel, and biomass burning) of +0.054 (0.0070.13) and +0.049 (0.0070.12) W m2, respectively. Snow forcing from only fossil fuel + biofuel sources is +0.043 W m2 (forcing from only fossil fuels is +0.033 W m2), suggesting that the anthropogenic contribution to total forcing is at least 80\%. The 1998 global land and sea-ice snowpack absorbed 0.60 and 0.23 W m2, respectively, because of direct BC/snow forcing. The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the efficacy of BC/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO2. The 1998 and 2001 land snowmelt rates north of 50N are 28\% and 19\% greater in the month preceding maximum melt of control simulations without BC in snow. With climate feedbacks, global annual mean 2-meter air temperature warms 0.15 and 0.10C, when BC is included in snow, whereas annual arctic warming is 1.61 and 0.50C. Stronger high-latitude climate response in 1998 than 2001 is at least partially caused by boreal fires, which account for nearly all of the 35\% biomass burning contribution to 1998 arctic forcing. Efficacy was anomalously large in this experiment, however, and more research is required to elucidate the role of boreal fires, which we suggest have maximum arctic BC/snow forcing potential during AprilJune. Model BC concentrations in snow agree reasonably well (r = 0.78) with a set of 23 observations from various locations, spanning nearly 4 orders of magnitude. We predict concentrations in excess of 1000 ng g1 for snow in northeast China, enough to lower snow albedo by more than 0.13. The greatest instantaneous forcing is over the Tibetan Plateau, exceeding 20 W m2 in some places during spring. These results indicate that snow darkening is an important component of carbon aerosol climate forcing.},

Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A semi-L-agrangian scheme is proposed by using forward trajectories and a splitting approach to the interpolation procedure. Several polynomial interpolation schemes are tested, including cubic spline and Lagrange polynomials of degree 3, 5 and 7. A simple filter is also proposed to eliminate spurious short waves and to achieve positive-definiteness. Uniform, rotational and Smolarkiewicz's deformational flows are tested, a solution to the inviscid Burger's equation is also provided. This new algorithm employing cubic-spline interpolation and the new filter yields efficient and accurate short-term simulations. The advantage in efficiency of adopting split trajectories for interpolation is accompanied by a restriction which is slightly more stringent than the stability criterion for conventional semi-L-agrangian advection schemes. It is also found that the simple filter can eliminate spurious short waves very effectively without degrading the solutions.},

	abstract = {Coplanar scans from three Doppler lidars are used to retrieve the horizontal wind field in a horizontal plane of about 5 km \texttimes{} 5 km in size above the city of Stuttgart in south-western Germany. Stuttgart is located in moderate mountainous terrain that is characterized by a basin-shaped valley (Stuttgart basin) which opens into the larger Neckar Valley. Using the retrieved horizontal wind field, which is available on 22 days with a temporal resolution of 1 min and a horizontal resolution of 100 m, we investigate the mesoscale structure of the horizontal flow in the valleys with respect to time of the day, stratification and wind above the mean ridge height, and determine how fast the cells in the convective boundary layer move downstream, i.e. we estimate the convection velocity. The measurements reveal a large spatial and temporal variability of the flow. During stable conditions, the flow below the mean ridge height is decoupled from the flow aloft and downvalley wind dominates in the valleys. At the opening of the Stuttgart basin into the Neckar Valley outflow dominates during nighttime, whereas inflow into the basin prevails in the early morning. During thermally unstable conditions the flow in the valleys is mainly coupled to the flow aloft with a preference for upvalley wind direction. Convective cells moving downstream are detected in the horizontal wind field and a method to estimate the convection velocity from the horizontal wind field measurements is presented. The mean convection velocity is found to be higher by 24 \% than the mean horizontal wind speed at the same height and about similar to the wind speed 100 m further up.},

Therefore, accurate wind power forecasting is a challenging task, which can significantly impact the effective operation of power systems. Wind power forecasting is also vital for planning unit commitment, maintenance scheduling and profit maximisation of power traders. The current development of cost-effective operation and maintenance methods for modern wind turbines benefits from the advancement of effective and accurate wind power forecasting approaches. This paper systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches of wind power forecasting with regard to physical, statistical (time series and artificial neural networks) and hybrid methods, including factors that affect accuracy and computational time in the predictive modelling efforts. Besides, this study provided a guideline for wind power forecasting process screening, allowing the wind turbine/farm operators to identify the most appropriate predictive methods based on time horizons, input features, computational time, error measurements, etc. More specifically, further recommendations for the research community of wind power forecasting were proposed based on reviewed literature.},

Year-round, isotope-constrained observations reveal strong seasonal variations in BC sources with a consistent and synchronous pattern at all Arctic sites. These sources were dominated by emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the winter and by biomass burning in the summer. The annual mean source of BC to the circum-Arctic was 39 $\pm$ 10\% from biomass burning. Comparison of transport-model predictions with the observations showed good agreement for BC concentrations, with larger discrepancies for (fossil/biomass burning) sources. The accuracy of simulated BC concentration, but not of origin, points to misallocations of emissions in the emission inventories. The consistency in seasonal source contributions of BC throughout the Arctic provides strong justification for targeted emission reductions to limit the impact of BC on climate warming in the Arctic and beyond.},

The EOF analysis suggested that observed ba was summarized by two modes: EOF1 and EOF2 represented 80\% (significant) and 6\% (insignificant) of the explained variance, respectively. EOF1 captured a decline in ba that was uniformly distributed in space at all stakes. The decline was correlated with albedo observations and air temperature observations from nearby stations. EOF2, however, described variations in ba that were heterogeneously distributed among stakes and associated with local slope and aspect. Low elevation stakes ($\sim$ < 400 m a.s.l.) showed relatively negative (out of phase) correlation and higher elevated stakes relatively positive (in phase) eigenvector correlation values with EOF2. Such relatively negative and positive eigenvector correlation values were present where the constituted of exposed glacier ice or snow cover, respectively. The results from this study show how EOF analyses can provide information on spatiotemporal patterns of glacier mass-balance. Understanding such detailed variabilities in mass-balance on a Greenlandic glacier is of interest because a fifth of the Arctic contribution from glaciers and ice caps to sea-level rise originates from Greenland.},

Radar travel times were converted to water equivalent, yielding snow-accumulation rates along the profile for three time periods: 1986-99,1963-99 and 1963-86. The results show 40-60\% spatial variability in snow accumulation over short distances along the profile.

	abstract = {Improvements to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model are made to enable multiscale simulations over highly complex terrain with dynamically downscaled boundary conditions from the mesoscale to the microscale. Over steep terrain, the WRF Model develops numerical errors that are due to grid deformation of the terrain-following coordinates. An alternative coordinate system, the immersed boundary method (IBM), has been implemented into WRF, allowing for simulations over highly complex terrain; however, the new coordinate system precluded nesting within mesoscale simulations using WRF's native terrain-following coordinates. Here, the immersed boundary method and WRF's grid-nesting framework are modified to seamlessly work together. This improved framework for the first time allows for large-eddy simulation over complex (urban) terrain with IBM to be nested within a typical mesoscale WRF simulation. Simulations of the Joint Urban 2003 field campaign in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, are performed using a multiscale five-domain nested configuration, spanning horizontal grid resolutions from 6 km to 2 m. These are compared with microscale-only simulations with idealized lateral boundary conditions and with observations of wind speed/direction and SF6 concentrations from a controlled release from intensive observation period 3. The multiscale simulation, which is configured independent of local observations, shows similar model skill predicting wind speed/direction and improved skill predicting SF6 concentrations when compared with the idealized simulations, which require use of observations to set mean flow conditions. Use of this improved multiscale framework shows promise for enabling large-eddy simulation over highly complex terrain with dynamically downscaled boundary conditions from mesoscale models.},

The lidar measurements provide line-of-sight tangent velocities across the vortex pair to over half the peak core velocity, whereas the wind tunnel measurements cover the full core region, extending nearly to the mid point. Measurements from the two systems may thus be compared over the overlap region of the vortex profile. Over this range the measured tangent velocity profiles show good agreement for vortices of comparable age. Vortex disturbance is brought about by atmospheric turbulence, and the effects are evident in the lidar data, leading to significant distortion of older vortices. Some implications of the results are discussed together with points of comparison for the two measurement systems. The complementary character of the information that may be derived from the two techniques is emphasised.},

The longwave incoming radiation can be estimated from two equations. One is valid for instantaneous values and one for daily means.

	abstract = {The climate history and dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet are studied using a coupled model of the depositional provenance and transport of glacier ice, allowing simultaneous prediction of the detailed isotopic stratigraphy of ice cores at all the major Greenland sites. Adopting a novel method for reconstructing the age-depth relationship, we greatly improve the accuracy of semiLagrangian tracer tracking schemes and can readily incorporate an age-dependent ice theology. The larger aim of our study is to impose new constraints on the glacial history of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Leading sources of uncertainty in the climate and dynamic history are encapsulated in a small number of parameters: the temperature and elevation isotopic sensitivities, the glacial-interglacial precipitation contrast and the effective viscosity of ice in the flow law. Comparing predicted and observed ice layering at ice core sites, we establish plausible ranges for the key model parameters, identify climate and dynamic histories that are mutually consistent and recover the past depositional elevation of ice cores to ease interpretation of their climatic records. With the coupled three-dimensional model of ice dynamics and provenance transport we propose a method to place all the ice core records on a common time scale and use discrepancies to adjust the reconstructed climate history. Analysis of simulated GRIP ice layering and borehole temperature profiles confirms that the GRIP record is sensitive to the dynamic as well as to the climatic history, but not enough to strongly limit speculation on the state of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Eemian. In contrast, our study indicates that the Dye 3 and Camp Century ice cores are extremely sensitive to ice dynamics and greatly constrain Eemian ice sheet reconstructions. We suggest that the maximum Eemian sea-level contribution of the ice sheet was in the range of 3.5-4.5 m. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Water levels in cryoconite holes were monitored at high resolution over a 3-week period on Austre Br{\o}ggerbreen (Svalbard). These data were combined with melt and energy balance modelling, providing insights into the evolution of the glacier's near-surface hydrology and confirming that the hydrology of the near-surface, porous ice known as the 'weathering crust' is dynamic and analogous to a shallow-perched aquifer. A positive correlation between radiative forcing of melt and drainage efficiency was found within the weathering crust. This likely resulted from diurnal contraction and dilation of interstitial pore spaces driven by variations in radiative and turbulent fluxes in the surface energy balance, occasionally causing 'sudden drainage events'. A linear decrease in water levels in cryoconite holes was also observed and attributed to cumulative increases in near-surface ice porosity over the measurement period. The transport of particulate matter and microbes between cryoconite holes through the porous weathering crust is shown to be dependent upon weathering crust hydraulics and particle size. Cryoconite holes therefore yield an indication of the hydrological dynamics of the weathering crust and provide long-term storage loci for cryoconite at the glacier surface. This study highlights the importance of the weathering crust as a crucial component of the hydrology, ecology and biogeochemistry of the glacier ecosystem and glacierized regions and demonstrates the utility of cryoconite holes as natural piezometers on glacier surfaces.},

The purpose of this research was to accurately simulate the microscale winci in the Chongli Mountain region. Coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is a method for simulating the microscale wind field over complex terrain. The performance of the WRF-CFD model in the Chongli Mountain region was enhanced from two aspects. First, as WRF offers multiple physical schemes, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate which scheme provided the best boundary condition for CFD. Second, to solve the problem of terrain differences between the WRF and CFD models, an improved method capable of coupling these two models is proposed. The results show that these improvements can enhance the performance of the WRF-CFD model and produce a more accurate microscale simulation of the wind field in the Chongli Mountain region.},

The annual period and the three seasonal periods have similar velocity azimuths and patterns, with fastest velocities along the centre line and in the upper tongue. Velocities in both summers are of similar magnitude, and greater than those in the autumn/winter/spring period. In all periods, longitudinal compression (increasing towards the snout) and transverse and vertical extension dominate the surface strain field. However, an area of longitudinal extension develops in the middle tongue during the 1998 summer. Surface strain patterns are used to estimate the components of the force balance. Basal drag is the dominant force resisting flow, but patterns are rather different between the three seasons. In summer 1998, a slippery spot in the upper-middle tongue is confined to the central part of the glacier. In autumn/winter/spring, this slippery spot has expanded towards the western glacier margin. In summer 1999, it has disappeared, and a slight sticky spot now covers virtually the entire upper and middle tongue. The location and extent of the slippery spot are explained in terms of the distribution of warm and cold ice, and the location and morphology of the subglacial drainage system, which control the patterns of water pressure beneath the glacier tongue.},

	abstract = {This study provides a detailed structural glaciological analysis of changes in surface structures on the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula prior to its collapse in February-March 2002. Mapped features include the ice-shelf front, rifts, crevasses, longitudinal linear surface structures and meltwater features. We define domains on the ice shelf related to glacier source areas and demonstrate that, prior to collapse, the central Larsen 0 ice shelf consisted of four sutured flow units fed by Crane, Jorum, Punchbowl and Hektoria/Green/Evans glaciers. Between these flow units were 'suture zones' of thinner ice where the feeder glaciers merged. Prior to collapse, large open-rift systems were present offshore of Foyn Point and Cape Disappointment. These rifts became more pronounced in the years preceding break-up, and ice blocks in the rifts rotated because of the strong lateral shear in this zone. Velocity mapping of the suture zones indicates that the major rifts were not present more than about 20 years ago. We suggest that the ice shelf was preconditioned to collapse by partial rupturing of the sutures between flow units. This, we believe, was the result of ice-shelf front retreat during 19982000, reducing the lateral resistive stress on the upstream parts of the shelf and glacier flow units, ice-shelf thinning and pre-shelf-break-up glacier acceleration.},

In laboratory experiments using well-controlled vibrating targets, and in computer simulations, the performance of the two modes is compared given the same average laser power. The accuracy of Doppler frequency (target velocity) estimates, and the signal-to-noise ratio in spectrally resolved plots of vibrational features, are evaluated. When the target-induced frequency modulation is wideband, pulse-pair often has clearly higher carrier-to-noise. But its advantage in signal-to-noise is smaller because combining the more numerous cw measurements improves the estimates of vibration frequencies and amplitudes. They are combined here through autocorrelation-based demodulation, one of several methods that can outperform phase-differencing.},

The ECHAM model was run under present-day climate conditions at two spatial resolutions (T42,T21), and the simulation results are compared with observations. The high-resolution model (T42) more realistically reproduced the observations, thus demonstrating that an improved representation of advection and orography is critical when modeling the global isotopic water cycle. The deuterium excess (d=\&\#948;D\&\#8722;8\textasteriskcentered\&\#948;18O) in precipitation offers additional information on climate conditions (e.g., relative humidity and temperature) which prevailed at evaporative sites. Globally, the simulated deuterium excess agrees fairly well with observations showing maxima in the interior of Asia and minima in cold marine regions. However, over Greenland the model failed to show the observed seasonality of the excess and its phase relation to \&\#948;D reflecting either unrealistic source areas modeled for Greenland precipitation or inadequate description of kinetics in the isotope module. When the coarse resolution model (T21) is forced with observed sea surface temperatures from the period 1979 to 1988, it reproduced the observed weak positive correlation between the isotopic signal and the temperature as well as the weak negative anticorrelation between the isotopic signal and the precipitation. This model simulation further demonstrates that the strongest interannual climate anomaly, the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation, imprints a strong signal on the water isotopes. In the central Pacific the anticorrelation between the anomalous precipitation and the isotope signal reaches a maximum value of\&\#8722;0.8.},

	year = {2002},
	abstract = {A coupled ice sheet-ice shelf-bedrock model was run at 20 km resolution to simulate the evolution of global ice cover during the last glacial cycle. The mass balance model uses monthly mean temperature and precipitation as input and incorporates the albedo-mass balance feedback. The model is forced by the GRIP and Vostok-derived temperature records (and by sea level and solar radiation variations), which are distributed spatially and seasonally. Model simulations show that at the last glacial maximum (LGM) a volume of ice representing about 65 m of sea level equivalent is stored on the Eurasian continent, whereas North America stores 42 m. The other regions (Greenland, Tibet, South-America and Antarctica) contribute about 17 in to global sea level lowering at the LGM compared to present day. Sensitivity experiments show that the ice volumes of the Eurasian and North American ice sheets are particularly sensitive to summer temperature changes. Finally, the timing and mechanism of grounded ice formation and expansion for the last glacial were studied for the Eurasian and North American continents. Ice sheet formation begins at 118 kyr BP in the Barents and Kara Sea region, over Baffin Island and in the high Cordilleran Range following a 4degreesC cooling. Alternating regions of ice sheet expansion by direct snowfall, ice flow and grounding of ice shelves can be identified. These relate to specific geomorphological traces, and may as such help in model validation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

A novel design procedure based on the co-design of antenna and amplifier predicted variations of the receiver gain within 4 dB in the frequency range from 140 GHz to 220 GHz, which an innovative measurement technique allowed to validate experimentally. 14 dB of maximum gain have been demonstrated, with variation below 6 dB in the frequency range from 140 GHz to 220 GHz. Compared against the state of art the presented design demonstrates the largest reported absolute and relative frequency band of operation, with an improvement of a factor 2 and 3 against previous art, respectively.},

	abstract = {The Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) is an enabling tool of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to support the United States National Climate Assessment. As a comprehensive system for evaluating climate models on regional and continental scales using observational datasets from a variety of sources, RCMES is designed to yield information on the performance of climate models and guide their improvement. Here, we present a user-oriented document describing the latest version of RCMES, its development process, and future plans for improvements. The main objective of RCMES is to facilitate the climate model evaluation process at regional scales. RCMES provides a framework for performing systematic evaluations of climate simulations, such as those from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), using in situ observations, as well as satellite and reanalysis data products. The main components of RCMES are (1) a database of observations widely used for climate model evaluation, (2) various data loaders to import climate models and observations on local file systems and Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) nodes, (3) a versatile processor to subset and regrid the loaded datasets, (4) performance metrics designed to assess and quantify model skill, (5) plotting routines to visualize the performance metrics, (6) a toolkit for statistically downscaling climate model simulations, and (7) two installation packages to maximize convenience of users without Python skills. RCMES website is maintained up to date with a brief explanation of these components. Although there are other open-source software (OSS) toolkits that facilitate analysis and evaluation of climate models, there is a need for climate scientists to participate in the development and customization of OSS to study regional climate change. To establish infrastructure and to ensure software sustainability, development of RCMES is an open, publicly accessible process enabled by leveraging the Apache Software Foundation's OSS library, Apache Open Climate Workbench (OCW). The OCW software that powers RCMES includes a Python OSS library for common climate model evaluation tasks as well as a set of user-friendly interfaces for quickly configuring a model evaluation task. OCW also allows users to build their own climate data analysis tools, such as the statistical downscaling toolkit provided as a part of RCMES.},

	author = {Ohmura, Atsumu},
	year = {2001},
	journal = {Journal Of Applied Meteorology},
	abstract = {The close relationship between air temperature measured at standard screen level and the rate of melt on snow and ice has been widely used to estimate the rate of melt. The parameterization of the melt rate using air temperature usually takes a simple form as a function of either the mean temperature for the relevant period or positive degree-day statistics. The computation provides the melt rate with sufficient accuracy for most practical purposes. Because of its simplicity, it is often called a crude method and is rated as inferior to other more sophisticated methods such as the energy balance method. The method is often used with the justification that temperature data are easily available or that obtaining energy balance fluxes is difficult. The physical process responsible for the temperature effect on the melt rate is often attributed to the sensible heat conduction from the atmosphere. The simulation capacity of the temperature-based melt-index method, however, is too good to be called crude and inferior. The author investigated physical processes that make the air temperature so effective a parameter for melt rate. Air temperature has a more profound influence on melt than previously has been acknowledged. The influence of air temperature through the turbulent sensible heat flux is limited, however. The air temperature information is transferred to the surface mainly through longwave atmospheric radiation, which is by far the most important heat source for melt. Under cloudless-sky conditions, as much as 60\% of the atmospheric emission is derived from within the first 100 m and 90\% from the first 1 km of the atmosphere. When the sky is overcast with the cloud bottom within the first 1 km, more than 90\% originates within this layer between the surface and the bottom of the cloud. When the sky is overcast with the cloud bottom higher than 1 km, the first 1 km of the atmosphere still makes up about 70\% of the longwave irradiance at the surface, for which the air temperature measured at standard screen level is the single most influential factor. Wind speed is only weakly correlated with melt rate, because the main energy source for melting is longwave atmospheric radiation, followed by the absorbed global radiation, both of which are independent of the movement of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The seasonal variability of hourly discharge of the Mittivakkat Glacier, SE Greenland was analyzed at the beginning and the end of the ablation period (May 2005 and August 2004). Spatial and temporal variations in the drainage system, water flow velocity, and travel time through the different media: snow, firn, and glacier ice were estimated. The glacier runoff hydrograph was calculated using the time-area method (a conceptual model) and the snow distribution was modeled using a physically based snow evolution model (SnowModel). Ink and dye tracer experiments, together with water flow measurements and observations, were conducted during August 2004 and May 2005 to estimate flow velocities through snow, firn, and glacier ice. The Mittivakkat Glacier contained five different water flow paths through the different media of the partially snow-covered glacier in August 2004, and three paths when the glacier was fully snow-covered in May 2005. In both August 2004 and May 2005, flow experiments revealed velocities ranging from 1.5\texttimes{} 10-4 to 4.3\texttimes{}10-4 m s-1 through the snow cover, 3.5\texttimes{}10-4 to 9.2\texttimes{}10-4 m s-1 at the interface between the snow and the impermeable glacier ice, an average of 5.0\texttimes{}10-2 m s-1 for inter-rill flow, a range from 0.46 to 1.84 m s-1 in supraglacial channels, and a maximum travel time of approximately 21 hours (time of concentration) through the different Mittivakkat Glacier flow paths. A 3 to 4 hour and 5 to 7 hour lag time occurred in August and May, respectively. On a daily basis, the hourly surface melt exceeded the hourly time-area glacier runoff from 4 a.m. to 3 p.m. in August and May, indicating a temporary englacial melt-water storage. The time-area glacier runoff was compared with stage observed runoff during August indicating a R2-value of 0.85. Daily peak runoff values of the time-area runoff and stage runoff correspond well in duration and variability, with a maximum range of 1.57 m3 s-1 for August.},

Among other revisions, the updated model includes an adjusted rainfall-to-snowfall conversion that produces exclusively snowfall under freezing conditions; this especially favours snowfall in summer. Summer snowfall in the ablation zone of the GrIS has a pronounced effect on melt rates, affecting modelled GrIS SMB in two ways. By covering relatively dark ice with highly reflective fresh snow, these summer snowfalls have the potential to locally reduce melt rates in the ablation zone of the GrIS through the snow-albedo-melt feedback. At larger scales, SMB changes are driven by differences in orographic precipitation following a shift in large-scale circulation, in combination with enhanced moisture to precipitation conversion for warm to moderately cold conditions. A detailed comparison of model output with observations from automatic weather stations, ice cores and ablation stakes shows that the model update generally improves the simulated SMB-elevation gradient as well as the representation of the surface energy balance, although significant biases remain.},

This paper chronicles initial testbed development to meet this proposed architecture. Focused development of UAV swarms with UAV-to-UAV communication autonomous coordination ability is central to advancing the utility of UAV swarms. The use of cellular mobile framework alleviates many limiting factors that hinder the utility of UAVs including range of communication, networking challenges, and size-weight-and-power considerations.

	abstract = {Ice and ocean core data suggest an increase in atmospheric dust loading at the Last Glacial Maximum, 21,000 years ago, relative to the present day. We present results from a new dust model; in contrast to previous modelling studies, we correctly simulate the observed provenance data in both Antarctica and Greenland, and obtain reasonable agreement with the dust deposition data. The observed increases are attributable to decreases in vegetation, increased surface wind strength, and increased particle lifetime (due to the drier LGM climate). The Patagonian provenance of Antarctic LGM dust is linked to a decrease in soil moisture and an extension in area of the source region, and a high transport efficiency between the two regions. The results show a high degree of interannual variability, which must be taken into account when interpreting previous modelling results.},

	doi = {10.1088/1748-9326/aac2f0},
	abstract = {Since 1992, there has been a revolution in our ability to quantify the land ice contribution to sea level rise using a variety of satellite missions and technologies. Each mission has provided unique, but sometimes conflicting, insights into the mass trends of land ice. Over the last decade, over fifty estimates of land ice trends have been published, providing a confusing and often inconsistent picture. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) attempted to synthesise estimates published up to early 2013. Since then, considerable advances have been made in understanding the origin of the inconsistencies, reducing uncertainties in estimates and extending time series. We assess and synthesise results published, primarily, since the AR5, to produce a consistent estimate of land ice mass trends during the satellite era (1992-2016). We combine observations from multiple missions and approaches including sea level budget analyses. Our resulting synthesis is both consistent and rigorous, drawing on (i) the published literature, (ii) expert assessment of that literature, and (iii) a new analysis of Arctic glacier and ice cap trends combined with statistical modelling. We present annual and pentad (five-year mean) time series for the East, West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and glaciers separately and combined. When averaged over pentads, covering the entire period considered, we obtain a monotonic trend in mass contribution to the oceans, increasing from 0.31 $\pm$ 0.35 mm of sea level equivalent for 1992-1996 to 1.85 $\pm$ 0.13 for 2012-2016. Our integrated land ice trend is lower than many estimates of GRACE-derived ocean mass change for the same periods. This is due, in part, to a smaller estimate for glacier and ice cap mass trends compared to previous assessments. We discuss this, and other likely reasons, for the difference between GRACE ocean mass and land ice trends.},

	abstract = {A characteristic feature of ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys on polythermal glaciers is an internal reflection presumably caused by the cold temperate transition surface (CTS), hence providing a possible tool for mapping thermal structure with high accuracy. Comparison of detailed temperature measurements in bore holes and GPR profiles at 345 MHz and 800 MHz center frequencies on Storglaciaren, Sweden, show that the CTS can be detected and mapped with an accuracy of about +/-1 m at both frequencies. A comparison between comprehensive GPR surveys of the cold surface layer, separated by 12 years (1989-2001), shows a substantial and complex thinning of the cold layer. An overall decrease of 8.3 m (22\% of average thickness) of the CTS depth is much larger than uncertainties in CTS depth determinations. The stability of the cold surface layer depends on the net ice ablation at the surface and the downward migration of CTS. There is no evidence of substantial increased net ablation between the survey dates that could explain the observed thinning. However, small increase in average winter air temperature, a limiting factor for the temperature gradient through the cold surface layer, may provide a partial explanation. The weaker temperature gradient reduces the transport of latent heat from the CTS, thus slowing down its downward migration.},

However, the classification of timescales varies significantly across the different studies (2010--2014). The timescale is important in specifying which methodology to use when, as well in uniting future research, data requirements, etc. This study proposes a generic statement on how to classify the timescales, and further presents different applications of these forecasts across the entire wind power value chain.},

Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

	abstract = {Aerosol trace element concentrations spanning an eleven month period at Dye 3, Greenland are presented. Sea salt input into the lower atmosphere of the ice sheet occurs predominantly in the winter months of December-February. These aerosols are the product of vigorous Arctic winter storms. Long range transport of crustal material from lower latitude arid regions to the Greenland Ice Sheet takes place predominantly during the spring. The onset of Arctic sunrise and associated weakening of the surface and upper level inversion over the ice sheet appear to be important factors resulting in higher crustal aerosol concentrations in the lower levels of the Greenland atmosphere during the month of April. A strong pulse of crustal aerosol (260 ng Al scm(-1)) was observed at Dye 3 on 14-15 April 1989. Meteorological evidence suggests that strong winds and deep convective activity injected dust high into the atmosphere over the Sahara desert region. This airmass then appears to have passed northward over western Europe where it mixed with anthropogenic aerosols and arrived in the Dye 3 region some 4-6 d hence. Elevated concentrations of anthropogenic aerosol species were also observed at the surface during the months of April and May. Long range transport of these aerosols appears to be important during the Arctic winter and spring, while enhanced downward mixing due to a weakening inversion results in elevated concentrations at the surface during April and May. An increase in scavenging due to persistent Arctic stratus and the northward migration of the Polar Front in the spring results in very low anthropogenic aerosol concentrations during the summer months. Particulate aerosol iodine and bromine concentrations also peak during the month of April at Dye 3. It has been suggested that this spring particulate halogen peak, which is observed throughout the Arctic, may be the result of photochemical aerosol production from biogenic organohalogen species. Regional meteorological phenomena as well as seasonal variations in source strength and long range transport appear to be important factors influencing aerosol concentrations in the surface atmosphere of the Greenland Ice Sheet.},

We used a machine learning-based workflow to predict high resolution (30 m) and sub-daily atmospheric variables fields of near-surface air temperature and humidity, and wind speed. The method used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition applied on ground stations observations or Global Climate Model (GCM) residual error, in a sequence with bias correction and statistical models (Linear Regression-LR, Artificial Neural Network model-ANN and Empirical Quantile Mapping-EQM) to provide downscaling from large scale atmospheric conditions to complex terrain variability. The predictions described relationships of Principal Component (PC) scores dependent on GCM temporal variability on 6-hourly basis (with LR or ANN or EQM), and PC loadings dependent on topographic indexes to help providing horizontal sub-grid extrapolation. The methods were validated with a 1-year dataset from a dense weather stations network deployed in a complex terrain basin in tropical climate of Southeast Brazil. We present an exhaustive description of the PC modes daily/seasonal variability for each variable, and their spatial variability associated to the topography and thermal driven circulations. The predictions in general substantially improved accuracy when compared to GCM outputs, especially near the valley and in sheltered area where local effects are mandatories. Specially, ANN and EQM significantly improved the predictions at the variability of extreme events, such as the formation of strong cold air pooling or wetting in the valley.},

	abstract = {The darkening effects of biological impurities on ice and snow have been recognised as a control on the surface energy balance of terrestrial snow, sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets. With a heightened interest in understanding the impacts of a changing climate on snow and ice processes, quantifying the impact of biological impurities on ice and snow albedo (<q>bioalbedo</q>) and its evolution through time is a rapidly growing field of research. However, rigorous quantification of bioalbedo has remained elusive because of difficulties in isolating the biological contribution to ice albedo from that of inorganic impurities and the variable optical properties of the ice itself. For this reason, isolation of the biological signature in reflectance data obtained from aerial/orbital platforms has not been achieved, even when ground-based biological measurements have been available. This paper provides the cell-specific optical properties that are required to model the spectral signatures and broadband darkening of ice. Applying radiative transfer theory, these properties provide the physical basis needed to link biological and glaciological ground measurements with remotely sensed reflectance data. Using these new capabilities we confirm that biological impurities can influence ice albedo, then we identify 10 challenges to the measurement of bioalbedo in the field with the aim of improving future experimental designs to better quantify bioalbedo feedbacks. These challenges are (1) ambiguity in terminology, (2) characterising snow or ice optical properties, (3) characterising solar irradiance, (4) determining optical properties of cells, (5) measuring biomass, (6) characterising vertical distribution of cells, (7) characterising abiotic impurities, (8) surface anisotropy, (9) measuring indirect albedo feedbacks, and (10) measurement and instrument configurations. This paper aims to provide a broad audience of glaciologists and biologists with an overview of radiative transfer and albedo that could support future experimental design.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a class of finite-difference approximations to the evolution equations of fluid dynamics. These approximations derive from elementary properties of differential forms. Values of a fluid variable psi at any two points of a space-time continuum are related through the integral of the space-time gradient of psi along an arbitrary contour connecting these two points (Stokes' theorem). Noting that spatial and temporal components of the gradient are related through the fluid equations, and selecting the contour composed of a parcel trajectory and an appropriate residual, leads to the integral form of the fluid equations, which is particularly convenient for finite-difference approximations. In these equations, the inertial and forcing terms are separated such that forces are integrated along a parcel trajectory (the Lagrangian aspect), whereas advection of the variable is evaluated along the residual contour (the Eulerian aspect). The virtue of this method is an extreme simplicity of the resulting solver; the entire model for a fluid may be essentially built upon a single one-dimensional Eulerian advection scheme while retaining the formal accuracy of its constant-coefficient limit. The Lagrangian aspect of the approach allows for large-Courant-number (> 1) computations in a broad spectrum of dynamic applications. Theoretical considerations are illustrated with examples of applications to selected classical problems of atmospheric fluid dynamics.Since the theoretical arguments adopted in this paper assume differentiability of fluid variables, fluid systems admitting truly discontinuous solutions (e.g., shock waves, hydraulic jumps) are formally excluded from our considerations.},

	abstract = {Urban turbulence characteristics are investigated at street canyon and neighbourhood scale. Three high resolution urban large-eddy simulation (LES) studies are performed using the urban version of the parallelized LES model PALM. Validation shows that the urban PALM version is in line with experimental and previous LES results, i.e. superior to the faster/cheaper conventional Reynolds-averaged (RANS) models. Two studies focus on quasi-2D urban street canyons driven by perpendicular flow. First is a parametric study of turbulence characteristics and flow dynamics within the canyon. The main results are: (1) Integral vertical turbulence profiles in deep canyons scale with canyon width. This is relevant for urban canopy parameterizations in larger-scale meteorological models. (2) A new concept of a "cavity shear layer" complements classical free shear layer concepts. (3) For the first time in urban LES Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are identified at the top of the urban street canyon. This is relevant for modelling urban dispersion, because the street canyon circulation is more intermittent than suggested by previous RANS results. Second, an Eulerian dispersion case study shows that differences in canyon flow dynamics are reflected in canyon dispersion characteristics compared to a previous RANS study. Third is a neighbourhood scale urban LES feasibility study: a passive tracer Lagrangian dispersion animation of Shinjuku, downtown Tokyo reveals turbulent flow features, upstream flow and intermittency. The main implications are always to use 3D models for turbulence simulations even in quasi-2D geometries, and not to underestimate the intermittency of turbulent flow. Standard deviations of velocity components within the canyon should not be treated as constant for perpendicular ambient wind but may be parameterized conveniently based on a vertical scaling with canyon width in deep canyons. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Monotonicity has been added to the basic method by the use of shape-preserving interpolation, and, more recently, by using ideas from flux corrected transport (FCT). In this Paper, the authors describe how to make the scheme quasi-conservative. Although the lack of conservation of the semi-Lagrangian method is not widely regarded as a serious problem, for climate studies, where many tens of thousands of time steps are needed, it could become so. The method proposed here is very cheap, and hence is a viable proposition for addition to existing semi-Lagrangian codes. Making the scheme conservative as well as monotone gives the scheme shock-capturing properties, thus making the method much more useful in application areas outside of meteorology.},

However, calculations of the global budget of atmospheric phosphorus have been unbalanced, with global deposition exceeding estimated emissions from dust and sea-salt transport, volcanic eruptions, biogenic sources and combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass, the latter of which thought to contribute about 5\% of total emissions. Here we use measurements of the phosphorus content of various fuels and estimates of the partitioning of phosphorus during combustion to calculate phosphorus emissions to the atmosphere from all combustion sources. We estimate combustion-related emissions of 1.8 Tg P yr-1, which represent over 50\% of global atmospheric sources of phosphorus. Using these estimates in atmospheric transport model simulations, we find that the total global emissions of atmospheric phosphorus (3.5 Tg P yr-1) translate to a depositional sink of 2.7 Tg P yr-1 over land and 0.8 Tg P yr-1 over the oceans. The modelled spatial patterns of phosphorus deposition agree with observations from globally distributed measurement stations, and indicate a near balance of the phosphorus budget. Our finding suggests that the perturbation of the global phosphorus cycle by anthropogenic emissions is larger thanpreviously thought.},

	abstract = {Ice at depth in ice sheets can be softer in bed-parallel shear than Glen's flow law predicts. For example, at Dye 3, Greenland, enhancement factors of 3-4 are needed in order to explain the rate of borehole tilting. Previous authors have identified crystal fabric as the dominant contributor, but the role of impurities and crystal size is still incompletely resolved. Here we use two formulations of anisotropic flow laws for ice (Azuma's and Sachs' models) to account for the effects of anisotropy, and show that: the measured anisotropy of the ice at Dye 3 cannot explain all the detailed variations in the measured strain rates. The jump in enhancement across the Holocene-Wisconsin boundary is larger than expected from the measured fabrics alone. Dust and soluble-ion concentration divided by crystal size correlates well with the residual enhancement, indicating that most of the "excess deformation" may be due to impurities or crystal size. While the major features of the deformation at Dye 3 are explained by anisotropy and temperature, results also suggest that further research into the role of impurities and crystal size is warranted.},

The model is forced with new datasets of temperature and precipitation patterns dating back to 1866. We use an innovative method to account for the influence of year-on-year surface elevation changes on SMB estimates and have found this effect to be minor. All SMB estimates are made relative to the 1961-90 average SMB and we compare annual SMB estimates from the period 1995-2005 to a similar period in the past (1923-33) where SMB was comparable, and conclude that the present-day changes are not exceptional within the last 140 years. Peripheral thinning has dominated the SMB response during the past decade, as in 1923-33, but we also show that thinning was not restricted to the margins during this earlier period.},

Solar radiation, longwave radiation, turbulent heatfluxes and refreezing of melt water in the snow pack are treated separately. The calculations show that changes in the earth's orbit during the Holocene must have had a significant effect on the mean specific balance of the Greenland ice sheet. The balance was smaller than today during most of the last 10 000 years, probably by as much as 0.05 m/yr. Further experimentation showed that the changes in the specific balance can be related to changes in summer insolation. In a warmer world, ablation will increase, but this will be compensated to some extent by increased snowfall. For a uniform warming of 1 K, and including a precipitation rate proportional to maximum possible atmospheric water content, the model predicts a contribution to sea level rise of 0.27 mm/yr. -from Author},

	abstract = {A coherent laser radar has been built by use of a master-oscillator power-amplifier arrangement in which the master oscillator is an external-cavity semiconductor laser and the power amplifier is an erbium-doped fiber amplifier with \sim{}1-W output at a wavelength of 1.55 \mathrm{\mu}m. The beams are routed within single-mode optical fiber, allowing modular construction of the optical layout with standard components. The system employs separate transmit and receive optics (a bistatic configuration) and has sufficient sensitivity for reliable Doppler wind-speed detection in moderate scattering conditions at short range (to as much as \sim{}200 m). The bistatic arrangement leads to a well-defined probe volume formed by the intersection of the transmitted laser beam with the virtual backpropagated local-oscillator beam. This could be advantageous for applications in which the precise localization of wind speed is required (e.g., wind tunnel studies) or in which smoke, low cloud, or solid objects can lead to spurious signals. The confinement of the probe volume also leads to a reduction in the signal power. A theoretical study has been carried out on the reduction in wind signal strength compared with the monostatic arrangement, and the results are compared with experimental observation.},

An accurate real-time wind estimation technique is crucial for tasks such as increasing air traffic capacity, commercial formation flight, or aerial refueling, etc. A leader-follower formation flight of Phastball Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) were used as the experimental platform for the above problem. The air data system of Phastball UAV was developed with pitot-tube and flow-angle sensors. Using the designed system, two Unscented Kalman Filters (one standalone UKF and one cooperative UKF) were developed for the wind field estimation with and without using the wake information from the leader aircraft. For close formation flights, the wake of the leader is assumed to be predictable by certain wake models for the follower aircraft. Flight data showed the effectiveness of the standalone EKF for the wind estimation compared with the ground weather station measurements. Simulation results showed the advantage of the cooperative UKF over the standalone UKF. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Automatic Control Council.},

	abstract = {The use of automated, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to deliver commercial packages is poised to become a new industry, significantly shifting energy use in the freight sector. Here we find the current practical range of multi-copters to be about 4 km with current battery technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting the size of drones.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional model problem for computation of the age field in ice sheets, which is of great importance for dating deep ice cores, is considered. The corresponding partial differential equation (PDE) is of purely advective (hyperbolic) type, which is notoriously difficult to solve numerically. By integrating the PDE over a space-time element in the sense of a finite-volume approach, a general difference equation is constructed from which a hierarchy of solution schemes can be derived. Iteration rules are given explicitly for central differences, first-, second- and third-order (QUICK) upstreaming as well as modified TVD Lax-Friedrichs schemes (TVDLFs). The performance of these schemes in terms of convergence and accuracy is discussed. Second-order upstreaming, the modified TVDLF scheme with Minmod slope limiter and, with limitations of the accuracy directly at the base, first-order upstreaming prove to be the most suitable for numerical age computations in ice-sheet models.},

	abstract = {Jakobshavn Isbrae, West Greenland, underwent a large, rapid and not well understood change in flow dynamics in 1998, leading to a doubling of its ice discharge rates. We calculate the width-averaged forces controlling flow of Jakobshavn Isbrae in 1995, 2000 and 2005 to elucidate processes responsible for this change in flow speed. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we conclude that the observed acceleration was not caused by the loss of back-stress due to weakening and subsequent break-up of the floating ice tongue alone. Gradients in longitudinal stress are small at all times considered (similar to 3\% of the driving stress) and basal and lateral drag provide resistance to flow. Over the 10 year period considered, the average driving stress increased by 20 kPa, which was balanced by a comparable increase in lateral drag. We surmise that the velocity changes resulted from weakening of the ice in the lateral shear margins and perhaps a change in properties at the bed. Possible mechanisms for weakening of ice in the lateral shear margins include cryo-hydrologic warming of subsurface ice in the ablation zone and hydraulic weakening due to higher water content of ice in the shear margins.},

	abstract = {Meteorological models were used to retrieve annual accumulation, runoff, and surface mass balance on a 5 km x 5 km grid for the Greenland ice sheet for 1958 - 2003. We present the first such history that provides insight into seasonal and interannual variability, which should prove useful for those studying the ice sheet. Derived runoff was validated by means of a control model run and independent in situ data. Modeled accumulation has already been validated using shallow ice core data. Surface mass balance (SMB) responds rapidly on a yearly basis to changing meteorological ( surface air temperature and precipitation) forcing. There are distinct signals in runoff and SMB following three major volcanic eruptions. Runoff losses from the ice sheet were 264 (+/- 26) km(3) yr(-1) in 1961 - 1990 and 372 (+/- 37) km(3) yr(-1) in 1998 - 2003. Significantly rising runoff since the 1990s has been partly offset by increased precipitation. Our best estimate of overall mass balance declined from 22 (+/- 51) km(3) yr(-1) in 1961 - 1990 to - 36 (+/- 59) km(3) yr(-1) in 1998 - 2003, which is not statistically significant. Additional dynamical factors that cause an acceleration of ice flow near the margins, and possible enhanced iceberg calving, may have led to a more negative mass balance in the past few years than suggested here. The implication is a significant and accelerating recent contribution from the ice sheet to global sea level rise, with 0.15 mm yr(-1) from declining SMB alone over the last 6 years.},

	abstract = {High spatial variability in snowmelt phenomena was observed in the experimental watershed of the upper Cordevole (7 km(2)), in the Dolomites. Snowmelt depends, at a point scale, on available energy, which in turn is heavily affected by slope, aspect and shading effects of the site. A distributed hourly model of snowmelt was set up as a geographical information system (GIS) module. The model accumulates snowfall for each raster element (20 m x 20 m) using a temperature threshold. It simulates snowmelt using air temperature and a radiation index consisting of daily average values of clear sky radiation that have cumulated at selected dates since 21 December. It should be underlined that the only relevant calibration parameter of the model is the combined snowmelt factor, which is unique for the whole basin. The clear sky radiation maps were computed for a selected period of the year, based on the watershed digital terrain model and the solar path sampled at very short intervals. When run for a season, the model produces snow water equivalent maps at given dates. The model was validated, with satisfactory results, by comparing these maps with 60 snow covered area surveys and related water equivalent measures collected in six snowmelt seasons from 1986 to 1991. The classical temperature index approach to snowmelt modelling does not allow the full variability over the basin to be taken into account. Besides, it seems important to point out that this fully distributed approach allows us to avoid the use of snow covered area (SCA) depletion curves, the definition of which still proves a troublesome task.},

	abstract = {Computation of trajectories by a kinematic method requires the numerical solution of the differential equation by which the trajectory is defined. A widely used method is the iterative scheme of Petterssen which has second-order accuracy. The convergence and accuracy of this scheme is investigated for some simple flow types where analytical solutions are available. The results are discussed in comparison to other methods, especially a method similar to the Petterssen scheme, which has been recommended for use in semi-Lagrangian advection schemes. The truncation error in trajectory calculations should be kept about one order of magnitude smaller than the total uncertainty, which is mainly due to analysis errors and limited resolution of the wind data. It is shown that for trajectory calculations based on the typical output of current numerical weather prediction models or comparable data, this requires a time step of about 15\% of the time step necessary to achieve convergence. If a fixed time step is used, it should not exceed about 0.5 h. Flexible time steps, based on the estimate of the truncation error which is provided by the difference between the first and the second iteration, are an attractive alternative.},

Although Greenland is heavily glacierised and thus highly relevant for all of the above points, a com- plete inventory of its glaciers was not available so far. Here we present the results and details of a new and complete in- ventory that has been compiled from more than 70 Landsat scenes (mostly acquired between 1999 and 2002) using semi- automated glacier mapping techniques. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used to derive drainage divides from wa- tershed analysis and topographic attributes for each glacier entity. To serve the needs of different user communities, we assigned to each glacier one of three connectivity levels with the ice sheet (CL0, CL1, CL2; i.e. no, weak, and strong connection) to clearly, but still flexibly, distinguish the local glaciers and ice caps (GIC) from the ice sheet and its outlet glaciers. In total, we mapped \sim{}20 300 glaciers larger than 0.05km2 (of which \sim{}900 are marine terminating), covering an area of 130 076km2, or 89 720km2 with- out the CL2 GIC. The latter value is about 50\% higher than the mean value of more recent previous estimates. Glaciers smaller than 0.5km2 contribute only 1.5\% to the total area but more than 50\% (11 000) to the total number. In contrast, the 25 largest GIC (> 500km2) contribute 28\% to the total area, but only 0.1\% to the total number. The mean eleva- tion of the GIC is 1700m in the eastern sector and around 1000m otherwise. The median elevation increases with dis- tance from the coast, but has only a weak dependence on mean glacier aspect.},

The stratigraphic structure of an ice sheet is an expression of its full depositional and dynamic history and thus presents a greater challenge to computer models than merely matching the contemporary ice thickness and areal extent. We describe a coupled model of ice and tracer dynamics that is realized by adding a semi-Lagrangian tracer transport scheme to a conventional thermomechanical ice dynamics model. Model skill is demonstrated by using ice core data from the GRIP site near Summit Greenland to successfully predict the isotopic stratigraphy of ice cores at other deep drilling sites. The success of this effort indicates that, when compensated for the effects of ice flow and elevation, all the deep cores relate a coherent glacial history over the past 120,000 years. According to the simulation results, the oldest Greenland ice lies beneath the GRIP, GISP2 and NorthGRIP sites although comparably old ice may also be found in North Greenland and East Central Greenland.

To this end, we first provide an overview on the general architecture of the prototype and experiment for UAV communications, and then present experimental verification for air-to-ground channel models and UAV energy consumption models. Next, we discuss measurement experiments on two promising paradigms of UAV communications, namely cellular-connected UAVs and UAV-enabled aerial communication platforms. For the former, we focus on the feasibility study and address the interference mitigation issue. For UAV-enabled aerial communication platforms, we present three scenarios, namely UAV-enabled aerial base stations, UAV-enabled aerial relays and UAV-enabled aerial data collection/dissemination. Finally, we point out some promising future directions for prototype and experimental measurements for UAV communications.},

Moreover, it is demonstrated that this wide variety of source-region changes all cause anticorrelated changes in deuterium excess with deltaD and delta(18)O over the ice sheets, suggesting that deuteriul4m excess is a generally more useful tool for correcting isotopic thermometers than is currently recognized.},

	abstract = {Snow albedo is known to be crucial for heat exchange at high latitudes and high altitudes, and is also an important parameter in General Circulation Models (GCMs) because of its strong positive feedback properties. In this study, seven GCM snow albedo schemes and a multiple linear regression model were intercompared and validated against 59 years of in situ data from Svalbard, the French Alps and six stations in the former Soviet Union. For each site, the significant meteorological parameters for modeling the snow albedo were identified by constructing the 95\% confidence intervals. The significant parameters were found to be: temperature, snow depth, positive degree day and a dummy of snow depth, and the multiple linear regression model was constructed to include these. Overall, the intercomparison showed that the modeled snow albedo varied more than the observed albedo for all models, and that the albedo was often underestimated. In addition, for several of the models, the snow albedo decreased at a faster rate or by a greater magnitude during the winter snow metamorphosis than the observed albedo. Both the temperature dependent schemes and the prognostic schemes showed shortcomings.},

	doi = {10.1175/JPO-D-11-03.1},
	abstract = {Subglacial meltwater draining along the bed of fast-flowing, marine-terminating glaciers emerges at the grounding line, where the ice either goes afloat to form an ice shelf or terminates in a calving face. The input of freshwater to the ocean provides a source of buoyancy and drives convective motion alongside the ice-ocean interface. This process is modeled using the theory of buoyant plumes that has previously been applied to the study of the larger-scale circulation beneath ice shelves. The plume grows through entrainment of ocean waters, and the heat brought into the plume as a result drives melting at the ice ocean interface. The equations are nondimensionalized by using scales appropriate for the region where the subglacial drainage. rather than the subsequent addition of meltwater, supplies the majority of the buoyancy forcing. It is found that the melt rate within this region can be approximated reasonably well by a function that is linear in ocean temperature, has a cube root dependence on the flux of subglacial meltwater. and has a complex dependency on the slope of the ice ocean interface. The model is used to investigate variability in melting induced by changes in both ocean temperature and subglacial discharge for a number of realistic examples of ice shelves and tidewater glaciers. The results show how warming ocean waters and increasing subglacial drainage both generate increases in melting near the grounding line.},

It reports the intercomparison of ten operational ice-sheet models and uses a series of experiments to examine the implications of thermomechanical coupling for model behaviour. A schematic, circular ice sheet is used in the work which investigates both steady states and the response to stepped changes in climate. The major finding is that the radial symmetry implied in the experimental design can, under certain circumstances, break down with the formation of distinct, regularly spaced spokes of cold ice which extended from the interior of the ice sheet outward to the surrounding zone of basal melt. These features also manifest themselves in the thickness and velocity distributions predicted by the models. They appear to be a common feature to all of the models which took part in the intercomparison, and may stem from interactions between ice temperature, flow and surface form. The exact nature of these features varies between models, and their existence appears to be controlled by the overall thermal regime of the ice sheet. A second result is that there is considerable agreement between the models in their predictions of global-scale response to imposed climate change.},

	abstract = {Doppler wind LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) makes use of the principle of optical Doppler shift between the reference and backscattered radiations to measure radial velocities at distances up to several kilometers above the ground. Such instruments promise some advantages, including its large scan volume, movability and provision of 3-dimensional wind measurements, as well as its relatively higher temporal and spatial resolution comparing with other measurement devices. In recent decades, Doppler LiDARs developed by scientific institutes and commercial companies have been well adopted in several real-life applications. Doppler LiDARs are installed in about a dozen airports to study aircraft-induced vortices and detect wind shears. In the wind energy industry, the Doppler LiDAR technique provides a promising alternative to in-situ techniques in wind energy assessment, turbine wake analysis and turbine control. Doppler LiDARs have also been applied in meteorological studies, such as observing boundary layers and tracking tropical cyclones. These applications demonstrate the capability of Doppler LiDARs for measuring backscatter coefficients and wind profiles. In addition, Doppler LiDAR measurements show considerable potential for validating and improving numerical models. It is expected that future development of the Doppler LiDAR technique and data processing algorithms will provide accurate measurements with high spatial and temporal resolutions under different environmental conditions.},

However, the natural uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource implies the occurrence of wind power forecasting errors which perform a considerable role in the impacts and costs in the wind energy integration and its commercialization. The main goal of this paper is to provide a deeper insight in the analysis of timing errors which leads to the proposal of a new methodology for its control and measure. A new methodology, based on Dynamic Time Warping, is proposed to be considered in the estimation of accuracy as attribute of forecast quality. A new dissimilarity measure, the Temporal Distortion Index, among time series is introduced to complement the traditional verification measures found in the literature. Furthermore we provide a bi-criteria perspective to the problem of comparing different forecasts. The methodology is illustrated with several examples including a real case.},

For a perfectly symmetrical confluence, the junction point of the two tributaries can be modeled as a no-slip/free-slip transition. A strongly localized surface depression develops around the junction point, accompanied by two broadly elevated zones positioned close to the margins of the tributaries facing the junction point. The confluence center line is subjected to horizontal longitudinal extension and a transverse compression. The compression generally exceeds the concomitant longitudinal extension in magnitude. Depth-integrated vertical strain rates along the center line are positive (extension), but the strain-rate variation with depth depends critically on the type of basal boundary conditions at the glacier bed. For a no-slip boundary condition, vertical strain rates change from positive at the surface to negative close to the base, whereas for a free-slip boundary condition (perfect sliding) vertical strain rates are positive throughout the depth. These theoretical results are compared with field measurements from Unteraargletscher, Bernese Alps, Switzerland.},

The vertically Lagrangian discretization reduces the dimensionality of the physical problem from three to two with the resulting dynamical system closely resembling that of the shallow water system. The 2D horizontal-to-Lagrangian-surface transport and dynamical processes are then discretized using the genuinely conservative flux-form semi-Lagrangian algorithm. Time marching is split-explicit, with large time steps for scalar transport, and small fractional steps for the Lagrangian dynamics, which permits the accurate propagation of fast waves. A mass, momentum, and total energy conserving algorithm is developed for remapping the state variables periodically from the floating Lagrangian control-volume to an Eulerian terrain-following coordinate for dealing with "physical parameterizations'' and to prevent severe distortion of the Lagrangian surfaces. Deterministic baroclinic wave-growth tests and long-term integrations using the Held-Suarez forcing are presented. Impact of the monotonicity constraint is discussed.},

Integrals within the SLICE scheme are computed using multiple sweeps of PSM along flow-dependent cascade directions to avoid the large timestep-dependent splitting errors associated with traditional fixed-direction splitting. Accuracy of the overall scheme, including at large timestep, is demonstrated using two-dimensional test problems in both Cartesian and spherical geometries and compared with that of the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) applied within the same SLICE framework.

	doi = {10.5194/tc-13-373-2019},
	abstract = {In the context of global warming, growing attention is paid to the evolution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to sea-level rise at the centennial timescale. Atmosphere-GrIS interactions, such as the temperature-elevation and the albedo feedbacks, have the potential to modify the surface energy balance and thus to impact the GrIS surface mass balance (SMB). In turn, changes in the geometrical features of the ice sheet may alter both the climate and the ice dynamics governing the ice sheet evolution. However, changes in ice sheet geometry are generally not explicitly accounted for when simulating atmospheric changes over the Greenland ice sheet in the future. To account for ice sheet-climate interactions, we developed the first two-way synchronously coupled model between a regional atmospheric model (MAR) and a 3-D ice sheet model (GRISLI). Using this novel model, we simulate the ice sheet evolution from 2000 to 2150 under a prolonged representative concentration pathway scenario, RCP8.5. Changes in surface elevation and ice sheet extent simulated by GRISLI have a direct impact on the climate simulated by MAR. They are fed to MAR from 2020 onwards, i.e. when changes in SMB produce significant topography changes in GRISLI. We further assess the importance of the atmosphere-ice sheet feedbacks through the comparison of the two-way coupled experiment with two other simulations based on simpler coupling strategies: (i) a one-way coupling with no consideration of any change in ice sheet geometry; (ii) an alternative oneway coupling in which the elevation change feedbacks are parameterized in the ice sheet model (from 2020 onwards) without taking into account the changes in ice sheet topography in the atmospheric model. The two-way coupled experiment simulates an important increase in surface melt below 2000m of elevation, resulting in an important SMB reduction in 2150 and a shift of the equilibrium line towards elevations as high as 2500 m, despite a slight increase in SMB over the central plateau due to enhanced snowfall. In relation with these SMB changes, modifications of ice sheet geometry favour ice flux convergence towards the margins, with an increase in ice velocities in the GrIS interior due to increased surface slopes and a decrease in ice velocities at the margins due to decreasing ice thickness. This convergence counteracts the SMB signal in these areas. In the two-way coupling, the SMB is also influenced by changes in finescale atmospheric dynamical processes, such as the increase in katabatic winds from central to marginal regions induced by increased surface slopes. Altogether, the GrIS contribution to sea-level rise, inferred from variations in ice volume above floatation, is equal to 20.4 cm in 2150. The comparison between the coupled and the two uncoupled experiments suggests that the effect of the different feedbacks is amplified over time with the most important feedbacks being the SMB-elevation feedbacks. As a result, the experiment with parameterized SMB-elevation feedback provides a sea-level contribution from GrIS in 2150 only 2.5\% lower than the two-way coupled experiment, while the experiment with no feedback is 9.3\% lower. The change in the ablation area in the two-way coupled experiment is much larger than those provided by the two simplest methods, with an underestimation of 11.7\% (14 \%) with parameterized feedbacks (no feedback). In addition, we quantify that computing the GrIS contribution to sea-level rise from SMB changes only over a fixed ice sheet mask leads to an overestimation of ice loss of at least 6\% compared to the use of a time variable ice sheet mask. Finally, our results suggest that ice-loss estimations diverge when using the different coupling strategies, with differences from the two-way method becoming significant at the end of the 21st century. In particular, even if averaged over the whole GrIS the climatic and ice sheet fields are relatively similar; at the local and regional scale there are important differences, highlighting the importance of correctly representing the interactions when interested in basin scale changes.},

	abstract = {Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and satellite ERS-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are used to map the thickness and extent of the superimposed ice (SI) zone on the surge-type glacier Kongsvegen, Svalbard. GPR imagery shows sub-horizontal SI layers lying unconformably above a discrete boundary. Below this boundary, the ice has a GPR signature similar to that of ice further down-glacier in the ablation zone. This boundary is posited to represent the closing of crevasses that were created during the last surge of Kongsvegen in similar to 1948. Open crevasses would have interrupted the formation of sheet layers of SI due to efficient vertical drainage of the snowpack. Aerial photographs suggest that the crevasses closed sometime in the period 1956-66. A classified SAR image from 2003 is used to delineate the extent of the SI zone. The SI extent in the SAR image agrees well with the SI zone mapped by GPR. Using the SI spatial depth distribution, we estimate the mean annual accumulation of superimposed ice to be 0.16 +/- 0.06 mw.e.a(-1) (locally up to 0.43 ma(-1) w.e.). This corresponds to similar to 15-33\% of the local winter balance and similar to 5-10\% of the total winter balance measured since 1987.},

A detailed comparison between Greenland (Dome Summit) and Antarctic (Vostok) records provides new insight on a potential link between northern and southern patterns. Ca is a good indicator of continental input and is mainly emitted as CaCO3. An attempt is made to estimate the contribution of aluminosilicates using the concentration of insoluble particles greater than 0.5 mu m in diameter. The relative abundance of non-sea-salt Mg and Ca and of aluminosilicate shows that the calcium content of continental background aerosol over Greenland was much higher during the glacial age. The neutralization capacity of carbonaceous aerosol is estimated. The inverse relationship between delta(18)O and continental input as well as the response of this input to the rapid climatic variations that have occurred during the second part of the glacial age are discussed in terms of source and transport modification in relation to the presence and the extent of the great Laurentide ice cap. The corresponding Vostok profiles strongly suggest that some of the phenomena observed at high northern latitudes are of global concern. The marine component of Na (Na-m) is a good tracer of sea-salt aerosol. Similarly to continental input, it shows an inverse but more linear relationship with delta(18)O. The sensitivity of Greenland and Antarctic marine input to climate variations of small and large amplitude is compared, and a corresponding estimation is made for the aeolian contribution. The respective influence of atmospheric circulation and the water vapor cycle is discussed. The chlorine to marine sodium weight ratio increases with temperature from values very close to the bulk seawater ratio during the last glacial maximum (18-20 kyr B.P.) to values significantly higher during the Holocene and warm Eemian. The corresponding excess of chloride (HCl) is discussed in terms of atmospheric transport, taking into account the role of atmospheric acidity on sea-salt fractionation processes. Owing to postdepositional phenomena, similar Vostok data must be considered cautiously. Nevertheless, aerosol fractionation seems to have been much more important over the Vostok site, except during glacial extrema.},

	abstract = {The response of the Greenland ice sheet geometry to glacial/interglacial climatic transition is studied by using a numerical ice sheet dynamical model. The possible contribution due to the increase in melting, snow accumulation, ice temperature and accumulation of harder ice during the Holocene is examined. The results imply that: (1) within 1000 years after the termination of the Ice Age, the present ice sheet became thicker than that during the Ice Age, mainly due to the increase in snow accumulation, (2) at present, about 10,000 years after the transition, the ice sheet is still reacting to the change in ice temperature and the advection of harder Holocene ice, effects which are partly compensating each other, (3) the central part of the ice sheet may be thinning slightly by about 4 mm per year because of the somewhat quicker response of the ice sheet to temperature change than to advection of the harder Holocene ice, (4) the influence due to the repetition of the ice age cycles is negligible. Since the rate of change at present is below the detection threshold, observation of the elevation change must be explained by the short-term climatic change.},

As a result, a new scheme for the trajectory equation is proposed and a class of schemes for the nonlinear residual, which are second-order accurate in time, are introduced. A simplified one-dimensional 'shallow water' model is developed in order to test the proposed scheme in comparison with other, previously known, ones. some experiments proving stability, accuracy and conservation ability are presented.},

Prominent experts provide everything students need to know about dynamical systems as students seek to develop sufficient mathematical skills to analyze the types of differential equations that arise in their area of study. The authors provide rigorous exercises and examples clearly and easily by slowly introducing linear systems of differential equations. Calculus is required as specialized advanced topics not usually found in elementary differential equations courses are included, such as exploring the world of discrete dynamical systems and describing chaotic systems.

	abstract = {This study presents the development of a method to statistically downscale daily wind speed variations in an extended Great Lakes region. A probabilistic approach is used, predicting a daily-varying probability density function (PDF) of local-scale daily wind speed conditioned on large-scale daily wind speed predictors. Advantages of a probabilistic method are that it provides realistic information on the variance and extremes in addition to information on the mean, it allows the autocorrelation of downscaled realizations to be tuned to match the autocorrelation of local-scale observations, and it allows flexibility in the use of the final downscaled product. Much attention is given to fitting the proper functional form of the PDF by investigating the observed local-scale wind speed distribution (predictand) as a function of the decile of the large-scale wind (predictor). It is found that the local-scale standard deviation and the local-scale shape parameter (from a gamma distribution) are nonconstant functions of the large-scale predictor. As such, a vector generalized linear model is developed to relate the large-scale and local-scale wind speeds. Maximum likelihood and cross validation are used to fit local-scale gamma distribution shape and scale parameters to the large-scale wind speed. The result is a daily-varying probability distribution of local-scale wind speed, conditioned on the large-scale wind speed. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

The speeds of Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim remained steady during the 1990s despite progressive and substantial thinning, but have abruptly increased within the last two years, more than doubling ice flux to the ocean. Had it been an isolated example, the comparable 1998 speed-up of Jakobshavn Isbr ae in West Greenland might have been explained simply by its chance retreat past a pinning point. Now that two further Greenland outlets have exhibited similar behavior, a common process seems likely. A remarkable correspondence in the inter-annual patterns of speed and ice-front variation between Kangerdlugssuaq and Helheim implies a significant sensitivity to regional environmental factors. The period of continued warming and thinning appears to have primed these glaciers for a step-change in dynamics not included in current models. We should expect further Greenland outlet glaciers to follow suit.},

	journal = {Journal of Geophysical Research},
	doi = {doi:10.1029/2004JD004945},
	abstract = {The first three-dimensional global model in which time-dependent spectral albedos and emissivities over snow and sea ice are predicted with a radiative transfer solution, rather than prescribed, is applied to study the climate response of fossil fuel plus biofuel black carbon plus organic matter (ff+bf BC+OM) when BC absorption in snow and sea ice is accounted for. The model treats the cycling of size-resolved BC+OM between emission and removal by dry deposition and precipitation from first principles. Particles produce and enter size-resolved clouds and precipitation by nucleation scavenging and aerosol-hydrometeor coagulation. Removal brings BC to the surface, where internally and externally mixed BC in snow and sea ice affects albedo and emissivity through radiative transfer. Climate response simulations were run with a ff+bf BC+OC emission inventory lower than that used in a previous study. The 10-year, globally averaged ff+bf BC+OM near-surface temperature response due to all feedbacks was about +0.27 K (+0.32 in the last 3 years), close to those from the previous study (5-year average of +0.3 K and fifth-year warming of +0.35 K) and its modeled range (+0.15 to +0.5 K) because warming due to soot absorption in snow and sea ice here (10-year average of +0.06 K with a modeled range of +0.03 to +0.11 K) offset reduced warming due to lower emission. BC was calculated to reduce snow and sea ice albedo by \sim{}0.4\% in the global average and 1\% in the Northern Hemisphere. The globally averaged modeled BC concentration in snow and sea ice was \sim{}5 ng/g; that in rainfall was \sim{}22 ng/g. About 98\% of BC removal from the atmosphere was due to precipitation; the rest was due to dry deposition. The results here support previous findings that controlling ff+bf BC+OM and CO2 emission may slow global warming.},

A Gaussian distribution is used to determine uncertainty in the time-varying wind fields. We use a Markov Decision Process to plan a path based upon the uncertainty of the Gaussian distribution. Simulation results are presented to compare the direct line of flight between a start and target point with our planned path for energy consumption and time of travel. The result of our method is a robust path using the most visited cell while sampling the Gaussian distribution of the wind field in each cell. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Because of similarities to the semi-Lagrangian approach of extending rime steps, the scheme is called flux-form semi-Lagrangian (FFSL). The FFSL scheme can be easily and efficiently implemented on the sphere. Idealized rests as well as realistic three-dimensional global transport simulations using winds from data assimilation systems are demonstrated. Stability is analyzed with a von Neuman approach as well as empirically on the 2D Cartesian plane. The resulting algorithm is conservative and upstream biased. In addition, it contains monotonicity constraints and conserves tracer correlations, therefore representing the physical characteristics of constituent transport.},

The focus is set on long-range scanning direct time of flight LiDAR systems using APD photodetectors. Miniaturization evokes severe problems in ensuring absolute laser safety while maintaining the systems' performance in terms of maximum range, signal-to-noise ratio, detection probability, pixel density, or frame rate. Based on hypothetical but realistic specifications for an exemplary system the complete lidar signal path is calculated. The maximum range of the system is used as a general performance indicator. It is determined with the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required to detect an object. Various system parameters are varied to find their impact on the system's range. The reduction of the laser's pulse width and the right choice for the transimpedance amplifier's amplification have shown to be practicable measures to double the system's range.},

	abstract = {Traditional laser scanners for 3D distance measurement involve expensive, heavy, (potentially) slow rotating mirrors for light deflection of the scanning TOF (time of flight) distance measurement, not suitable for compact, robust and highly portable LIDAR system. On the other hand MEMS scanners are limited to small apertures not suitable for a precise TOF measurement. To overcome this problem Fraunhofer IPMS presents a large aperture 1D-MEMS scanner array especially designed for LIDAR applications. It is composed of 2 \&times; 7 silicon mirror elements each having an identical design with comparatively large aperture of 2.51 \&times; 9.51mm<sup>2</sup> and \&plusmn;30\&deg; optical scan range. All mirrors are driven electrostatically resonant with identical frequency close to design frequency of 250 Hz. By driving control all single scanner elements are synchronized to identical phase and amplitude in respect to a master scanner. This results in a large effective scanner aperture of 334 mm<sup>2</sup> for the receiver optics and a filling factor of 80 \%. To guarantee the synchronized operation the paper discusses in detail the scanner design to enable a sufficiently large frequency bandwidth of all scanner elements to the compensate frequency tolerances caused by fabrication and packaging. In comparison to LIDAR systems with conventional scanner components, the large aperture 1D-MEMS scanner array enables 3D-LIDAR systems to become significantly smaller, more robust and (potentially) less expensive, also higher scan rates can be realized without additional efforts (e.g. no air bearings are needed).},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing trend in wind and solar energy generation globally and it is expected that an important percentage of total energy production comes from these energy sources. However, they present inherent variability that implies fluctuations in energy generation that are difficult to forecast. Thus, forecasting errors have a considerable role in the impacts and costs of renewable energy integration, management, and commercialization. This study presents an important advance in the task of analyzing prediction models, in particular, in the timing component of prediction error, which improves previous pioneering results. A new method to match time series is defined in order to assess energy forecasting accuracy. This method relies on a new family of step patterns, an essential component of the algorithm to evaluate the temporal distortion index (TDI). This family minimizes the mean absolute error (MAE) of the transformation with respect to the reference series (the real energy series) and also allows detailed control of the temporal distortion entailed in the prediction series. The simultaneous consideration of temporal and absolute errors allows the use of Pareto frontiers as characteristic error curves. Real examples of wind energy forecasts are used to illustrate the results.},

Moreover, fjord bathymetry regulates the penetration of warm Atlantic water (AW) that rapidly melts and undercuts Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers. Here we present a new compilation of Greenland bed topography that assimilates seafloor bathymetry and ice thickness data through a mass conservation approach. A new 150?m horizontal resolution bed topography/bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 $\pm$ 0.05 m, which is 7?cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.},

	abstract = {We study the mechanisms of glacial inception by using the Earth system model of intermediate complexity, CLIMBER-2, which encompasses dynamic modules of the atmosphere, ocean, biosphere and ice sheets. Ice-sheet dynamics are described by the three-dimensional polythermal ice-sheet model SICOPOLIS. We have performed transient experiments starting at the Eemiam interglacial, at 126 ky BP (126,000 years before present). The model runs for 26 kyr with time-dependent orbital and CO2 forcings. The model simulates a rapid expansion of the area covered by inland ice in the Northern Hemisphere, predominantly over Northern America, starting at about 117 kyr BP. During the next 7 kyr, the ice volume grows gradually in the model at a rate which corresponds to a change in sea level of 10 in per millennium. We have shown that the simulated glacial inception represents a bifurcation transition in the climate system from an interglacial to a glacial state caused by the strong snow-albedo feedback. This transition occurs when summer insolation at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere drops below a threshold value, which is only slightly lower than modern summer insolation. By performing long-term equilibrium runs, we find that for the present-day orbital parameters at least two different equilibrium states of the climate system exist-the glacial and the interglacial; however, for the low summer insolation corresponding to 115 kyr BP, we find only one, glacial, equilibrium state, while for the high summer insolation corresponding to 126 kyr BP only an interglacial state exists in the model.},

	abstract = {A global nonhydrostatic semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian (SISL) atmospheric model with orography has been developed. The height-based terrain-following sigma(z) coordinate of Gal-Chen and Somerville is used to incorporate the orography. A 3D vector form of the SISL formulation is proposed. It is based on the complete Navier-Stokes equations. The model is stable for large time steps of up to 1 h at horizontal/vertical resolution of 2.8125 degrees/1200 m. Isolated bell-shaped mountain profiles and real orography are employed to evaluate the model performance. The sensitivity of the model with orography to the order of accuracy of the uncentering scheme, the reference temperature ((T) over bar), and size of the time step are similar to that of the model without orography described in Semazzi et al. The authors find that for successful execution of the model, it is important that the orographic height Z(s), the reference state mass variable ((q) over bar(s)), and (T) over bar satisfy the hydrostatic balance relationship in the terrain-following sigma(z) coordinate system. This formulation effectively controls the generation of unphysical orographic induced computational noise usually encountered in connection with semi-Lagrangian models. The global model used here is based on the complete dynamical Navier-Stokes equations, however, it is run at coarse resolutions, for which nonhydrostatic effects are negligible. In the future, when the computing resources permit, the model will be a valuable vehicle for investigating the role of multiple-scale interaction, including the effects of nonhydrostatic dynamics.},

In case ofsoft-targets --- collections of vast numbers of weakly scattering elements filling the radar beam --- the emphasis typically shifts to collecting the statistics of random motions of the scattering elements --- i.e., Doppler spectral estimation --- from which thermal or turbulent state of the target can be inferred, as appropriate. For instance, in case of a plasma in thermal equilibrium, e.g., the quiescent ionosphere, a Doppler radar of sufficient power-aperture-product can detect, in addition to the plasma drift velocities, the densities, temperatures, and even current densities of charged particle populations of the probed plasma --- such Doppler radars used in ionospheric research are known as incoherent scatter radars(ISR). In this chapter we will provide a simplified description of ISR spectral theories (e.g., Kudeki \& Milla, 2011) and also discuss magnetoionic propagation effects pertinent to ionospheric applications of ISR's at low latitudes. A second chapter in this volume focusing on in-beam imaging of soft-targets by Hysell \& Chau (2012) is pertinent to non-equilibrium plasmas and complements the topics covered in this article.},

	abstract = {The stable isotope records of delta D and delta(18)O in ice cores show that the isotopic gradients are smoothed out with time by diffusion. Transport of hydrogen and oxygen atoms through solid ice is slow whereas water vapor diffusion through the interconnected porosity is much faster. Smoothing occurs preferentially in the upper layers of firn, where the density is lowest, and is responsible for the gradual alteration of the isotopic stratigraphy. Results for the diffusion of water vapor in ice are presented. They were obtained from laboratory experiments with diffusion couples prepared using artificial snow with different D/H values. The samples were allowed to diffuse for about one year at a controlled temperature before being cut into thin sections and analyzed with a mass spectrometer. The effects of both temperature and density were investigated. The measured diffusion coefficients are fully consistent with water vapor diffusion through the ice porosity. The computed values are less than the diffusion coefficient of HDO in free-air and imply a tortuosity factor in the range 3.2-6.5 depending on the sample density. The influence of the grain sizes on the timescale of the isotopic homogenization between the vapor phase and the ice matrix was studied. We show that for grain sizes up to 1 mm in diameter, solid diffusion within the grains is not a limiting factor and therefore, the isotopic equilibrium between the vapor and the solid phases can be considered as immediate. The diffusion model developed to compute the diffusion coefficients was further applied to investigate the real case of isotope smoothing in ice cores. The smoothing rate is highly dependent on the wavelength of the isotopic signal, linked to the accumulation rate, and on temperature. Finally, the model was applied to tritium deposition in Antarctica, from a continuous record of artificial fallout at the South Pole (1954-1978). The result shows that in spite of large gradients, the initial distribution underwent only limited smoothing that did not exceed 10\%. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities and temporal and spatial variability, as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscaling, we review perfect prognosis statistical downscaling, model output statistics, and weather generators, focusing on recent developments to improve the representation of space-time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, subdaily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in small-scale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal variations of surface albedo on Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, during the 1993 and 1994 ablation seasons are described. Correlation and regression analyses are used to explain the albedo variations in terms of independent meteorological and surface property variables. Parameterizations are developed which allow estimation of albedo variation in surface energy-balance models. Snow albedo is best estimated from accumulated daily maximum temperatures since snowfall. On "deep" snow (greater than or equal to0.5 cm we. depth) a logarithmic function is used, while on "shallow" snow (<0.5 cm w.e, depth) an exponential function is used to enable the albedo to decay to the underlying ice or debris albedo. The transition from "deep" to "Shallow" snow is calculated as a function of decreasing snow depth (combined r(2) = 0.65). This new parameterization performs better than earlier schemes because accumulated daily maximum temperatures since snowfall correlate strongly with snow grain-size and impurity concentration, the main physical controls on snow albedo. Ice albedo may be parameterized by its relationship to elevation (r(2) = 0.28), but this approach results in only a small improvement over the assumption of a constant mean ice albedo.},

The results provide a recent record of rBC deposition in the East Greenland ice sheet from 1990 to 2016. The annual variability in oxygen (O) and hydrogen ($\delta$D) isotopic compositions indicated that notably warm events occurred since 2008. Peaks in rBC occurred during summer seasons, which may be attributed to the burning of biomass in boreal summer. The rBC record and analysis of historical air trajectories using the HYSPLIT model indicated that anthropogenic BC emissions from Russia, North America and Europe contributed to the majority of rBC deposition in the Greenland region, and a reduction in anthropogenic BC consumption in these areas played a dominant role in the decrease in BC concentrations since 2000. This record also suggests that the emissions from the East Asian region (China) contributed very little to the recorded BC concentrations in East Greenland ice core. The model results indicated that radiative forcing due to BC had decreased significantly since 1990, and had remained below 0.02 W m-2 since 2000.},

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has been losing mass at an accelerating rate since the mid-1990s. This has been due to both increased ice discharge into the ocean and melting at the surface, with the latter being the dominant contribution. This change in state has been attributed to rising temperatures and a decrease in surface albedo. We show, using satellite data and climate model output, that the abrupt reduction in surface mass balance since about 1995 can be attributed largely to a coincident trend of decreasing summer cloud cover enhancing the melt-albedo feedback. Satellite observations show that, from 1995 to 2009, summer cloud cover decreased by 0.9 $\pm$ 0.3\% per year. Model output indicates that the GrIS summer melt increases by 27 $\pm$ 13 gigatons (Gt) per percent reduction in summer cloud cover, principally because of the impact of increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone. The observed reduction in cloud cover is strongly correlated with a state shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation promoting anticyclonic conditions in summer and suggests that the enhanced surface mass loss from the GrIS is driven by synoptic-scale changes in Arctic-wide atmospheric circulation.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present a literature review of the general and environmental effects of e-commerce in various parts of the demand-supply chain. These are further translated into effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the food production and consumption system. The literature study revealed many opportunities for e-commerce to reduce GHG emissions in the food production and consumption system. Some possibly negative effects were also identified. Electronic grocery shopping (e-grocery) home delivery service was chosen as the subject of a case study because of its direct and indirect potential for reducing the GHG emissions in the food production and consumption system. GHG emission reduction potential through the implementation of various e-grocery home delivery strategies was quantified. Depending on the home delivery model used, it is possible to reduce the GHG emissions generated by grocery shopping by 18\% to 87\% compared with the situation in which household members go to the store themselves. We estimate that the maximum theoretical potential of e-grocery home delivery service for reducing the GHG emissions of Finland is roughly 0.3\% to 1.3\%; however, the current and estimated future market potential is much smaller, because the estimated market share of e-grocery services is only 10\% by 2005. Narrowing the gap between the theoretical and the actual potential requires a model that would simultaneously provide additional value to the consumer and be profitable to companies. To be able to achieve significant reductions in GHG emissions, system-level innovations and changes are required. Further research is needed before conclusions can be reached as to whether e-commerce and e-grocery are useful tools in that respect.},

The aircraft is based on a commercially available radio-controlled glider; it is equipped with an autopilot module for low-level flight control and on-board computer that hosts all autonomy algorithms. Components of the autonomy algorithm include thermal mapping, explore/exploit decision making, navigation , optimal airspeed computation, thermal centering control, and energy state estimation. A finite state machine manages flight behaviors and switching between behaviors. Flight tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground resulted in 7.8 h flight time with the autonomous soaring system engaged, with three hours spent climbing in thermals.

This paper showcases how an Integrated Multi-scale Environmental Urban Model (IMEUM) can be employed to support planners, architects and engineers to assess the combined impacts of the UHI phenomenon and rising global temperatures due to climate change. IMEUM concept derives from downscaling environmental models from global scale (25 km) to mesoscale (1 km) and city scale (100 m). Hence, this paper showcases a computationally efficient method which couples multi-scale atmospheric models with statistical model to estimate weather parameters. Developed under Singapore context, IMEUM can be utilized to incorporate appropriate UHI mitigation measures upfront in design process, consecutively bridging the gap between global and building scale. This paper also includes calibration of the IMEUM output using observations from ground sensors. Furthermore, by using case study of a hypothetical office building, this paper showcases how the IMEUM output can be fully converted into a localized weather data file for cooling load simulation. IMEUM is currently being developed further into integrated quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST), which can be used to test the immediate microclimatic impact of development plans and assess their long term impacts under future climate change scenarios.},

High winds during rain-on-snow events can lead to catastrophic flooding while strong redistribution events in mountain environments can generate dangerous avalanche conditions. To provide adequate warnings, accurate wind data are required. Yet, mountain wind fields exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity at small spatial lengths that are not resolved by currently available gridded forecast data. Wind data from over 200 stations across Switzerland were used to evaluate two forecast surface wind products (- and 7-km horizontal resolution) and develop a statistical downscaling technique to capture these finer-scaled heterogeneities. Wind exposure metrics derived from a 25-m horizontal resolution digital elevation model effectively segregated high, moderate, and low wind speed sites. Forecast performance was markedly compromised and biased low at the exposed sites and biased high at the sheltered, valley sites. It was also found that the variability of predicted wind speeds at these sites did not accurately represent the observed variability. A novel optimization scheme that accounted for local terrain structure while also nudging the forecasted distributions to better match the observed distributions and variability was developed. The resultant statistical downscaling technique notably decreased biases across a range of elevations and exposures and provided a better match to observed wind speed distributions.},

Given potential climate change impacts and the requirement to develop cities sustainably, the need for sound modelling and observational tools becomes pressing. This review paper considers progress made in studies of the UBL in terms of a conceptual framework spanning microscale to mesoscale determinants of UBL structure and evolution. Considerable progress in observing and modelling the urban surface energy balance has been made. The urban roughness sub-layer is an important region requiring attention as assumptions about atmospheric turbulence break down in this layer and it may dominate coupling of the surface to the UBL due to its considerable depth. The upper 90\% of the UBL (mixed and residual layers) remains under-researched but new remote sensing methods and high resolution modelling tools now permit rapid progress. Surface heterogeneity dominates from neighbourhood to regional scales and should be more strongly considered in future studies. Specific research priorities include humidity within the UBL, high-rise urban canopies and the development of long-term, spatially extensive measurement networks coupled strongly to model development.},

The present study analyzes the economic impact of a potential disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS). The study introduces an approach that combines long-run economic growth models, climate models, and reduced-form GIS models. The study demonstrates that social cost{\textendash}benefit analysis and damage-limiting strategies can be usefully extended to illuminate issues with major long-term consequences, as well as concerns such as potential tipping points, irreversibility, and hysteresis. A key finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change. It finds that the cost of GIS disintegration adds less than 5\% to the social cost of carbon (SCC) under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS dynamics.},

	abstract = {[1] Our understanding of the global dust cycle is limited by a dearth of information about dust sources, especially small-scale features which could account for a large fraction of global emissions. Here we present a global-scale high-resolution (0.1) mapping of sources based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue estimates of dust optical depth in conjunction with other data sets including land use. We ascribe dust sources to natural and anthropogenic (primarily agricultural) origins, calculate their respective contributions to emissions, and extensively compare these products against literature. Natural dust sources globally account for 75\% of emissions; anthro-pogenic sources account for 25\%. North Africa accounts for 55\% of global dust emissions with only 8\% being anthropo-genic, mostly from the Sahel. Elsewhere, anthropogenic dust emissions can be much higher (75\% in Australia). Hydro-logic dust sources (e.g., ephemeral water bodies) account for 31\% worldwide; 15\% of them are natural while 85\% are anthropogenic. Globally, 20\% of emissions are from vegetated surfaces, primarily desert shrublands and agricultural lands. Since anthropogenic dust sources are associated with land use and ephemeral water bodies, both in turn linked to the hydrological cycle, their emissions are affected by climate variability. Such changes in dust emissions can impact climate, air quality, and human health. Improved dust emission estimates will require a better mapping of threshold wind velocities, vegetation dynamics, and surface conditions (soil moisture and land use) especially in the sensitive regions identified here, as well as improved ability to address small-scale convective processes producing dust via cold pool (haboob) events frequent in monsoon regimes.},

	abstract = {We investigate climate change impacts transferred via foreign trade to Germany, a country that is heavily engaged in international trade. Specifically, we look at temperature changes and the associated labour productivity losses at a global scale until 2050. We assess the effects on Germany's imports and exports by means of a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. To address uncertainty, we account for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using projections from five global climate models. We find that average annual labour productivity for high intensity work declines by up to 31\% for RCP4.5 (and up to 38\% for RCP8.5) in Southeast Asia and the Middle East by 2050, all relative to a 2050 baseline without climate change. As a consequence, for RCP8.5, Germany's imports from regions outside Europe are lower by up to 2.46\%, while imports from within Europe partly compensate this reduction. Also, Germany's exports to regions outside Europe are lower, but total exports increase by up to 0.16\% due to higher exports to EU regions. Germany's GDP and welfare, however, are negatively affected with a loss of up to - 0.41\% and - 0.46\%, respectively. The results highlight that overall positive trade effects for Germany constitute a comparative improvement rather than an absolute gain with climate change.},

We show that the introduction of carbon tariffs can do more harm than good to domestic EITE industries. Two determinants drive the sign and magnitude of EITE impacts. First, the composition of embodied emissions in intermediate inputs to EITE production: if a large share of embodied carbon is imported in intermediate inputs, industries might suffer from cost increases due to carbon tariffs. Second, the share of domestic output that is supplied to the export market: while carbon tariffs level the playing field on domestic markets, they increase the cost disadvantage vis-{\`a}-vis competitors from abroad in foreign markets.},

	abstract = {With the third trading period of the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) starting in 2013, the system of allocating emission allowances will significantly change: In contrast to the previous two trading periods, auctioning of the allowances should now be the rule rather than the exception. Accompanying this policy change, concerns over competitiveness of energy intensive, trade exposed sectors as well as over limited environmental effectiveness via the channel of carbon leakage, have regained prominence. In this paper, we thus explore the impacts of potential EU policies to counter losses in international competitiveness and carbon leakage from the perspective of Austria. Based on numerical simulations with a computable general equilibrium model, we evaluate three policy options: an input subsidy for carbon allowances (thus reflecting the planned partially free allocation mechanism in the third EU ETS phase), a subsidy for domestic production, and an export rebate based on sectoral CO 2 costs. Our results show that each policy has the potential to support domestic production in exposed sectors relative to a full auctioning scenario and thus increase competitiveness. However, none is imperatively effective at reducing Austria's net carbon emissions: while the carbon trade balance is improved and hence leakage declines, the tradability of emission permits within the EU ETS allows CO 2 emissions from Austria's ETS output to increase. A cost benefit analysis indicates that the two policies promoting domestic output and exports are more cost effective than the CO 2 input subsidy. {\copyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We quantify the macroeconomic effects of a large-scale expansion of wind and photovoltaics (PV) in Europe, employing a global multi-regional multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We place special emphasis on electricity market integration costs, which have so far been neglected not only in most bottom-up technology comparisons, but also in macroeconomic studies. We find that the societal welfare effects of a large-scale expansion of wind and PV tend to be positive; however, when integration costs are taken into account, positive welfare effects are either much smaller or even become negative, depending very much on regional characteristics, such as the prevailing electricity mix, weighted average costs of capital (WACC) or capacity factors. We also show that macroeconomic feedback effects raise generation costs above what is anticipated from a bottom-up perspective, since the high capital intensities of renewable electricity generation technologies drive up economy-wide capital prices. This may imply that they are no longer competitive when installed at large-scales.},

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the most serious threats to the human habitat. The required structural change to limit anthropogenic forcing is expected to fundamentally change daily social and economic life. The production of iron and steel is a special case of economic activities since it is not only associated with combustion but particularly with process emissions of greenhouse gases which have to be dealt with likewise. Traditional mitigation options of the sector like efficiency measures, substitution with less emission-intensive materials, or scrap-based production are bounded and thus insufficient for rapid decarbonization necessary for complying with long-term climate policy targets. Iron and steel products are basic materials at the core of modern socio-economic systems, additionally being essential also for other mitigation options like hydro and wind power. Therefore, a system-wide assessment of recent technological developments enabling almost complete decarbonization of the sector is substantially relevant. Deploying a recursive-dynamic multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium approach, we investigate switches from coke-to hydrogen-based iron and steel technologies in a scenario framework where industry decisions (technological choice and timing) and climate policies are misaligned. Overall, we find that the costs of industry transition are moderate, but still ones that may represent a barrier for implementation because the generation deciding on low-carbon technologies and bearing (macro)economic costs might not be the generation benefitting from it. Our macroeconomic assessment further indicates that anticipated bottom-up estimates of required additional domestic renewable electricity tend to be overestimated. Relative price changes in the economy induce electricity substitution effects and trigger increased electricity imports. Sectoral carbon leakage is an imminent risk and calls for aligned course of action of private and public actors.},

The meandering polar jet was at the origin of both dust emission through cyclogenesis over Northwest Africa and poleward transport of the uplifted dust toward the Arctic, through cut-off circulation. The dust emission was associated with an intense Saharan cyclone that formed over Northwest Africa in early April 2011. The formation of the cyclone was caused by the intrusion into subtropics, of a high-latitude-upper-level trough, linked to the meandering polar jet. The trough initiated cyclogenesis over Northwest Africa after orographic blocking by the Anti-Atlas Mountains. The still meandering polar jet led to the formation of a cut-off low further south with which the Saharan dust-cyclone merged 2 days later and moved northward with the main stream. Beside satellite observations, a simulation at high resolution was performed using the prognostic-dust permitting model MesoNH. The total dust load carried during this event to areas located north of 40 N was estimated by the model to be 38 Tg and dust deposition was estimated to be 1.3 Tg. The Saharan dust reaching Greenland was accompanied by warm and moist air masses that caused a rise in surface temperature of about 10C for more than 3 consecutive days over the southeastern Greenland. Ice melt over this area of Greenland was detected in the brightness temperature observations.},

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has been a topic of extensive scientific research over the past several decades due to the exponential increase in its melting. The relationship between air pollution and GrIS melting was reviewed based on local emission of air pollutants, atmospheric circulation, natural and anthropogenic forcing, and ground/satellite-based measurements. Among multiple factors responsible for accelerated ice melting, greenhouse gases have long been thought to be the main reason. However, it is suggested that air pollution is another piece of the puzzle for this phenomenon. In particular, black carbon (BC) and other aerosols emitted anthropogenically interact with clouds and ice in the Arctic hemisphere to shorten the cloud lifespan and to change the surface albedo through alteration of the radiative balance. The presence of pollution plumes lowers the extent of super cooling required for cloud freezing by about 4◦C, while shortening the lifespan of clouds (e.g., by altering their free-energy barrier to prompt precipitation). Since the low-level clouds in the Arctic are 2--8 times more sensitive to air pollution (in terms of the radiative/microphysical properties) than other regions in the world, the melting of the GrIS can be stimulated by the reduction in cloud stability induced by air pollution. In this study, we reviewed the possible impact of air pollution on the melting of the GrIS in relation to meteorological processes and emission of light-absorbing impurities. Long-term variation of ground-based AERONET aerosol optical depth in Greenland supports the potential significance of local emission and long-range transport of air pollutants from Arctic circle and continents in the northern hemisphere in rapid GrIS melting trend.},

Perspectives on the changes in sea ice and navigability are crucial to the circulation pattern and future of the Arctic. In this investigation, the decadal changes in sea ice parameters were evaluated by the multi-model from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6, and Arctic navigability was assessed under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and two vessel classes with the Arctic transportation accessibility model. The sea ice extent shows a high possibility of decreasing along SSP5-8.5 under current emissions and climate change. The decadal rate of decreasing sea ice extent will increase in March but decrease in September until 2060, when the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point. Sea ice thickness is expected to decrease and transit in certain parts, declining by-0.22 m per decade after September 2060. Both the sea ice concentration and volume will thoroughly decline at decreasing decadal rates, with a greater decrease in volume in March than in September. Open water ships will be able to cross the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage between August and October during the period from 2045 to 2055, with a maximum navigable percentage in September. The time for Polar Class 6 (PC6) ships will shift to October-December during the period from 2021 to 2030, with a maximum navigable percentage in October. In addition, the central passage will be open for PC6 ships between September and October during 2021-2030.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to provide a case for advancing methods in Arctic shipping towards a more complete approach. A methods assessment was used to identify core concepts in Arctic shipping and to develop a modelling approach that integrates together policy, alternative fuels, emissions and microeconomic theory - enabling the exploration of financial and implicit damage costs, opportunities and environmental risks within Arctic shipping. The integration of these paradigms can lead to more detailed insights into the economic feasibility of Arctic routes under different policy scenarios. The results indicate that by 2035 under both a business as usual and an Arctic zero emission ECA policy scenario, combined Arctic-Suez transits becomes financially viable for a Handymax wet bulker with a moderate ice class.

The results also show that implicit damage costs cannot be overlooked and that it is possible to advance towards more holistic methods for assessing economic and environmental risks and opportunities in Arctic shipping.

	abstract = {In recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70$\,^{\circ}$ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest-steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2.5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65$\,^{\circ}$ N are larger than emissions from the anthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60$\,^{\circ}$ N, with 56\% of black carbon emissions above 65$\,^{\circ}$ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning - indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.},

BC concentrations after about 1951 were lower but increasing. At its maximum from 1906 to 1910, estimated surface climate forcing in early summer from BC in Arctic snow was about 3 watts per square meter, which is eight times the typical preindustrial forcing value.},

	abstract = {Black carbon (BC) has emerged as an important short-lived climate forcer. Due to its light absorption properties, BC can darken the snow/ice surface, affect the energy balance, and further lead to acceleration of the melting of the cryosphere (e.g., glaciers, snow cover, and sea ice). By reviewing the recent published literatures, we present an overview of the historical changes, spatial distribution of BC in snow/ice, and how these changes are related to the cryospheric melting. Ice core records show a rapid increase of BC concentrations that began in the 1850s and continued throughout the 20th century, which is consistent with an increase of BC emissions owing to industrialization. A decrease of BC amount since 1970s in Arctic and European ice cores has been partially attributed to the Clean Air Act. However, in the Himalayas, BC records show a continuous increase during this period. Generally, BC concentrations in snow and ice in the mid-latitude regions are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those in the polar regions. In particular, BC concentrations in aged snow and granular ice in the ablation areas of mountain glaciers are one to three orders of magnitude higher than those in fresh snow or snowpits in the glacier accumulation areas due to BC accumulation during melting season. BC in the surface snow/ice is responsible for about 20\% of the albedo reduction in the Tibetan Plateau during glacier melt season. Globally, observations and modeling results indicate that radiative forcing (RF) induced by BC in snow and ice is highest in the mid-latitudes, ranging from several W m-2 in fresh snow to hundreds of W m-2 in aged snow and granular ice in the glacier ablation areas. The large BC-in-snow RF and associated snow albedo feedback lead to an acceleration in the total glacier melt (approximately 20\%) and/or a reduction in the duration of the snow cover by several days, resulting in an increase of glacier discharge. Given our limited understanding of quantifying the role of BC in cryospheric melting, it is important to synthesize the existing research on the multi-scale processes related to BC in snow and ice to identify the gaps in our understanding of these processes and to propose a path forward to improve the quality of our observations of the aforementioned phenomena to fill these gaps.},

	abstract = {In the Arctic, impurities in the atmosphere and cryosphere can strongly affect the atmospheric radiation and surface energy balance. While black carbon has hence received much attention, mineral dust has been in the background. Mineral dust is not only transported into the Arctic from remote regions but also, possibly increasingly, generated in the region itself. Here we study mineral dust in the Arctic based on global transport model simulations. For this, we have developed a dust mobilization scheme in combination with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART. A model evaluation, based on measurements of surface concentrations and annual deposition at a number of stations and aircraft vertical profiles, shows the suitability of this model to study global dust transport. Simulations indicate that about 3\% of global dust emission originates from high-latitude dust sources in the Arctic. Due to limited convection and enhanced efficiency of removal, dust emitted in these source regions is mostly deposited closer to the source than dust from for instance Asia or Africa. This leads to dominant contributions of local dust sources to total surface dust concentrations (~85\%) and dust deposition (~90\%) in the Arctic region. Dust deposition from local sources peaks in autumn, while dust deposition from remote sources occurs mainly in spring in the Arctic. With increasing altitude, remote sources become more important for dust concentrations as well as deposition. Therefore, total atmospheric dust loads in the Arctic are strongly influenced by Asian (~38\%) and African (~32\%) dust, whereas local dust contributes only 27\%. Dust loads are thus largest in spring when remote dust is efficiently transported into the Arctic. Overall, our study shows that contributions of local dust sources are more important in the Arctic than previously thought, particularly with respect to surface concentrations and dust deposition.},

	abstract = {Climate models predict a shift toward warmer and drier environments in southwestern North America. The consequences of such a shift for dust mobilization and dust concentration are unknown, but they could have large implications for human health, given the connections between dust inhalation and disease. Here we link a dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-LMfire) to a chemical transport model (GEOSChem) to assess the impacts of future changes in three factors - climate, CO2 fertilization, and land use practices - on vegetation in this region. From there, we investigate the impacts of changing vegetation on dust mobilization and assess the net effect on fine dust concentration (defined as dust particles less than 2.5 ?m in diameter) on surface air quality. We find that surface temperatures in southwestern North America warm by 3.3K and precipitation decreases by nearly 40\% by 2100 in the most extreme warming scenario (RCP8.5; RCP refers to Representative Concentration Pathway) in spring (March, April, and May) - the season of greatest dust emissions. Such conditions reveal an increased vulnerability to drought and vegetation die-off. Enhanced CO2 fertilization, however, offsets the modeled effects of warming temperatures and rainfall deficit on vegetation in some areas of the southwestern US. Considering all three factors in the RCP8.5 scenario, dust concentrations decrease over Arizona and New Mexico in spring by the late 21st century due to greater CO2 fertilization and a more densely vegetated environment, which inhibits dust mobilization. Along Mexico s northern border, dust concentrations increase as a result of the intensification of anthropogenic land use. In contrast, when CO2 fertilization is not considered in the RCP8.5 scenario, vegetation cover declines significantly across most of the domain by 2100, leading to widespread increases in fine dust concentrations, especially in southeastern New Mexico (up to \sim{}2.0 \ensuremath{\mu}gm-3 relative to the present day) and along the border between New Mexico and Mexico (up to \sim{}2.5 \ensuremath{\mu}gm-3). Our results have implications for human health, especially for the health of the indigenous people who make up a large percentage of the population in this region.},

The resulting global data base includes data for c. 250 sites, covering the period 1954 to 2012. Most (82\%) of the measurement locations are in Europe and North America, with 44 in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South-Central America. The deposition rates are log-normally distributed, and for the whole data set the geometric mean deposition rates are 0.027, 0.019 and 0.14 g m {\`A}2 a {\`A}1 for TP, FTP and PO 4-P respectively. At smaller scales there is little systematic spatial variation, except for high deposition rates at some sites in Germany, likely due to local agricultural sources. In cases for which PO 4-P was determined as well as one of the other forms of P, strong parallels between logarithmic values were found. Based on the directly-measured deposition rates to land, and published estimates of P deposition to the oceans, we estimate a total annual transfer of P to and from the atmosphere of 3.7 Tg. However, much of the phosphorus in larger particles (principally primary biological aerosol particles) is probably redeposited near to its origin, so that long-range transport, important for tropical forests, large areas of peatland and the oceans, mainly involves fine dust from deserts and soils, as described by the simulations of Mahowald et al. (Global Biogeochemical Cycles 22, GB4026, 2008). We suggest that local release to the atmosphere and subsequent deposition bring about a pseudo-diffusive redistribution of P in the landscape, with P-poor ecosystems, for example ombrotrophic peatlands and oligotrophic lakes, gaining at the expense of P-rich ones. Simple calculations suggest that atmospheric transport could bring about significant local redistribution of P among terrestrial ecosystems. Although most atmospherically transported P is natural in origin, local transfers from fertilised farmland to P-poor ecosystems may be significant, and this requires further research. Environmental impact Phosphorus is redistributed among terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems by atmospheric emission, transport, and deposition. At large scales, the ne dust from deserts and soils contains P that can move over long distances, providing a signicant nutrient source to the oceans, tropical forests and remote peatlands. At smaller scales, transfers from surrounding land to freshwater lakes, or between neighbouring terrestrial ecosystems, involve a wider range of particle sizes. Present estimates indicate that only a few percent of atmospherically transported P is anthropogenic, but more research is needed to quantify and assess atmospheric emissions from agricultural land that has received large quantities of P fertiliser.},

	abstract = {Atlantic tropical cyclones are getting stronger on average, with a 30-year trend that has been related to an increase in ocean temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere 1-4. Over the rest of the tropics, however, possible trends in tropical cyclone intensity are less obvious, owing to the unreliability and incompleteness of the observational record and to a restricted focus, in previous trend analyses, on changes in average intensity. Here we overcome these two limitations by examining trends in the upper quantiles of per-cyclone maximum wind speeds (that is, the maximum intensities that cyclones achieve during their lifetimes), estimated from homogeneous data derived from an archive of satellite records. We find significant upward trends for wind speed quan-tiles above the 70th percentile, with trends as high as 0.3 6 0.09 m s 21 yr 21 (s.e.) for the strongest cyclones. We note separate upward trends in the estimated lifetime-maximum wind speeds of the very strongest tropical cyclones (99th percentile) over each ocean basin, with the largest increase at this quantile occurring over the North Atlantic, although not all basins show statistically significant increases. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that as the seas warm, the ocean has more energy to convert to tropical cyclone wind. An important concern about the consequences of climate change is the potential increase in tropical cyclone activity. Theoretical arguments 5,6 and modelling studies 7,8 indicate that tropical cyclone winds should increase with increasing ocean temperature. Direct observational verification of this relationship over the global tropics is lacking, but Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), which is correlated with global mean near-surface air temperature, helps explain 1 the recent upswing in frequency and intensity of Atlantic tropical cyclones. However, it has been argued that the data are not reliable enough to make assertions about the relationship between climate change and hurricanes 9-13 and that the correlation may involve both regional and remote SSTs 14,15. Here we shed new light on this topic by using globally consistent satellite-derived tropical cyclone wind speeds 16 and by focusing on the lifetime-maximum wind speeds of the strongest tropical cyclones each year. Figure 1a shows the satellite-derived lifetime-maximum wind speeds grouped by year over the period 1981-2006, displayed as box plots (see Supplementary Information). The number of cyclones per year over the globe is shown above the time axis; there is no trend in these counts. Also, there is no trend in the median lifetime-maximum wind speed, as shown by the nearly horizontal red line, which is the best-fit line through the annual 50th-percentile values (black dashes inside the boxes). However at cyclone wind speeds above the median, upward trends are noted. Thus, the upper-quartile value (top of the box) is increasing (green line) and so are higher quantile values (for example the top of the vertical dashed line), where the upward trends are more pronounced. To quantify and determine the significance of these trends, we use quantile regression. Quantile regression as employed here is a method to estimate the change (trend) in lifetime-maximum wind speed quantile as a function of year.

The resulting darkening of the Arctic and its amplification of global warming was hypothesized almost 50 y ago but has yet to be verified with direct observations. This study uses satellite radiation budget measurements along with satellite microwave sea ice data to document the Arctic-wide decrease in planetary albedo and its amplifying effect on the warming. The analysis reveals a striking relationship between planetary albedo and sea ice cover, quantities inferred from two independent satellite instruments. We find that the Arctic planetary albedo has decreased from 0.52 to 0.48 between 1979 and 2011, corresponding to an additional 6.4 $\pm$ 0.9 W/m2 of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25\% as large as that due to the change in CO2 during this period, considerably larger than expectations from models and other less direct recent estimates. Changes in cloudiness appear to play a negligible role in observed Arctic darkening, thus reducing the possibility of Arctic cloud albedo feedbacks mitigating future Arctic warming.},

	abstract = {This paper uses two models to examine the direct and indirect costs of sea-level rise for Europe for a range of sea-level rise scenarios for the 2020s and 2080s: (1) the DIVA model to estimate the physical impacts of sea-level rise and the direct economic cost, including adaptation, and (2) the GTAP-EF model to assess the indirect economic implications. Without adaptation, impacts are quite significant with a large land loss and increase in the incidence of coastal flooding. By the end of the century Malta has the largest relative land loss at 12\% of its total surface area, followed by Greece at 3.5\% land loss. Economic losses are however larger in Poland and Germany ( million, respectively). Coastal protection is very effective in reducing these impacts and optimally undertaken leads to protection levels that are higher than 85\% in the majority of European states. While the direct economic impact of sea-level rise is always negative, the final impact on countries' economic performances estimated with the GTAP-EF model may be positive or negative. This is because factor substitution, international trade, and changes in investment patterns interact with possible positive implications. The policy insights are (1) while sea-level rise has negative and huge direct economic effects, overall effects on GDP are quite small (max -0.046\% in Poland); (2) the impact of sea-level rise is not confined to the coastal zone and sea-level rise indirectly affects landlocked countries as well (Austria for instance loses -0.003\% of its GDP); and (3) adaptation is crucial to keep the negative impacts of sea-level rise at an acceptable level.},

	abstract = {Climate change impacts on coastal zones could be significant unless adaptation is undertaken. One particular macroeconomic dimension of sea level rise (SLR) impacts that has received no attention so far is the potential stress of SLR impacts on public budgets. Adaptation will require increased public expenditure to protect assets at risk and could put additional stress on public budgets. We analyse the macroeconomic effects of SLR adaptation and impacts on public budgets. We include fiscal indicators in a climate change impact assessment focusing on SLR impacts and adaptation costs using a computable general equilibrium model extended with a detailed description of the public sector. Coastal protection expenditure is financed issuing government bonds, meaning that coastal adaptation places an additional burden on public budgets. SLR impacts are examined using several scenarios linked to three different Representative Concentration Pathways: 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP2 and SSP5. Future projections of direct damages of mean and extreme SLR and adaptation costs are generated by the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment framework. Without adaptation, all regions of the world will suffer a loss and public deficits increase respect to the reference scenario. Higher deficits imply higher government borrowing from household savings reducing available resources for private investments therefore decreasing capital accumulation and growth. Adaptation benefits result from two mechanisms: (i) the avoided direct impacts, and (ii) a reduced public deficit effect. This allows for an increased capital accumulation, suggesting that support to adaptation in deficit spending might trigger positive effects on public finance sustainability.},

We combine our analysis, focusing on the global level, as well as on individual G20 countries, with the corresponding stylized RCP mitigation efforts in order to understand the implications of interactions across mitigation, adaptation and sea level rise on a macroeconomic level. Our global results indicate that until the middle of this century, differences in macroeconomic impacts between the two climatic scenarios are small, but increase substantially towards the end of the century. Moreover, direct economic impacts can be partially absorbed by substitution effects in production processes and via international trade effects until 2050. By 2100 however, we find that this dynamic no longer holds and economy-wide effects become even larger than direct impacts. The disturbances of mitigation efforts to the overall economy may in some regions and for some scenarios lead to a counterintuitive result, namely to GDP losses that are higher in RCP26 than in RCP45, despite higher direct coastal damages in the latter scenario. Within the G20, our results indicate that China, India and Canada will experience the highest macroeconomic impacts, in line with the respective direct climatic impacts, with the two first large economies undertaking the highest mitigation efforts in a cost-efficient global climate action. A sensitivity analysis of varying socioeconomic assumptions highlights the role of climate-resilient development as a crucial complement to mitigation and adaptation efforts.},

	abstract = {Computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling is an attempt to use general equilibrium theory as a tool for analysis of resource allocation and income distribution issues in market economies. Since the beginning of the 1990s, CGE modeling has been widely used for analysis of environmental policy and natural resource management issues. The purpose of this chapter is to review this branch of CGE modeling. Most existing CGE models are static, but as faster computers and more efficient software have become available, an increasing number of environmental CGE models are dynamic. In addition to the static-dynamic dimension, it is useful to distinguish between single-country, multi-country and global models. Some environmental CGE models are primarily focused on the external effects of production and consumption, while others are designed to elucidate various issues related to the management of natural resources. However, most existing CGE models are focused on externalities, primarily emissions of greenhouse gases. Global "externality" CGE models have been used to estimate the social cost of complying with the Kyoto Protocol, while single-country models, among many other things, have been used for evaluation of the efficiency of emission taxes and other environmental policy instruments. CGE modeling currently is both a field for specialists and an almost standard part of the toolbox of economists concerned with policy-oriented research. A major reason for the widespread use of CGE modeling probably is that a CGE model is an ideal bridge between economic theory and applied policy research. The "bridge" perspective, however, suggests that CGE modeling is a way of using rather than testing economic theory. Yet carefully designed and estimated CGE models have a lot to say about real world economies. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In a study of the economics of climate change commissioned by the British government, released on 30 October, the former World Bank chief economist Sir Nicholas Stern presents a vigorously argued case for early curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions and proposes mitigation strategies that appear to offer highly favorable benefit-cost ratios. An excerpt from the Executive Summary of the Stern Review, concerned with the nature and magnitude of the deleterious economic consequences of anticipated climate change, is printed below. The principal scientific reviews of knowledge of climate change, its consequences, and mitigation strategies are the (roughly) quinquennial reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the work of hundreds of lead authors, subjected in turn to elaborate peer review and line-by-line scrutiny by interested governments. They represent a broad, though not total, expert consensus. The third IPCC assessment was issued in 2001; the fourth, already in draft, will be released next year. The Stern Review draws heavily on this scientific underpinning, but goes further than the IPCC exercise in computing economic values for the projected changes and costing out remedial policy responses. More forthright in style and emphatic in its conclusions, it reads as a resounding call to international action. The Review explores the implications of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being capped at 550ppm (parts per million), double the preindustrial level, an objective it argues is feasible. That concentration would be reached by 2050 at current emission rates, or by 2035 if emissions rise as expected. The resulting warming, it believes, would be 2-5$\,^{\circ}$C, roughly in accord with the IPCC's third-assessment estimates (see the Documents section of PDR 27, no. 1 for the IPCC projections). The positive feedbacks identified in some recent studies, generated by processes such as release of methane from permafrost, could lead to still higher temperatures. The forecast effects described are by now familiar, though no less grim for being so: species extinctions, expanding disease zones, reductions in surface water availability, coastal flooding, ocean acidification, and so on. The Review translates these effects into economic losses, adjusting for risk, using Monte Carlo simulation applied to an integrated assessment model (the so-called PAGE 2002 model). The exercise, requiring many heroic - and often contestable - assumptions, produces the most quoted figures in the report: that climate change "will reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to a reduction in consumption per head of between 5 and 20\%" - now and into the future. The absolute magnitude of those projected economic losses is made arbitrarily large by their permanence. Typical benefit-cost calculations applied to appraisal of development projects convert such long-term trajectories into a present value using a discount rate comparable to a market interest rate or some (lower) assumed rate of time preference. The Stern Review, however, argues that any discounting is ethically inappropriate for this global issue: "if a future generation will be present, we suppose that it has the same claim on our ethical attention as the current one" (p. 31). The only exception is an allowance for the possibility that future generations are not present - through human extinction - which is held to justify a minuscule discount rate of 0.1 percent per annum (p. 161). The percentage economic losses from climate change appear less daunting if set against the recent pace of expansion in the world economy. Real per capita income growth since 1990 has averaged about 1.5 percent per year worldwide, and about 3 percent in developing countries. In such a regime, a 5 percent one-time drop to a lower expansion path is no more than a two- or three-year delay in attaining a given income level. For China and India, whose economies are doubling in size each decade, even a 20 percent reduction in income would be a mere hiccough on the path to affluence - hardly enough to motivate major shifts in lifestyle ambitions. The dire repercussions on global environments of a greenhouse warming at the upper end of the forecast range are poorly captured by those percentages. Demography has a marginal place in the Review. The underlying IPCC emission scenarios incorporate expected population growth, using the UN medium projections. Many of the climate-change effects incur costs that are similarly magnified by population growth. One-sixth of the world's population is "threatened" by water scarcities; 1 in 20 people may be displaced by a rising sea level; mortality may increase from vector-borne diseases and from malnutrition linked to income losses. The later part of the Review is concerned with mitigation and adaptation strategies. It lays out an ambitious set of policies for transition to a low-carbon economy that could stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations over the next several decades. By 2050, emissions would have to be 25 percent below today's and emissions per unit of GDP 75 percent below. In perhaps the most problematic part of the exercise the Review asserts that such cuts could be achieved at a cost of only around 1 percent of annual global GDP - implying that investment in mitigation should be strongly favored on straightforward economic grounds. (This figure, like others in the Review, is acknowledged to lie within a substantial envelope of uncertainty - here a range of -1.0 percent to +3.5 percent of global GDP (p. 212), or, drawing on a wider range of models, -4 percent to +15 percent (p. 241).) In the decades before the investment pays off, adverse consequences of the warming trends already underway must be dealt with by adaptation, such as through better disaster preparedness, lessening the vulnerability of infrastructure, and risk-pooling measures.

	abstract = {<p><![CDATA[Abstract. With the highest albedo of the land surface, snow plays a vital role in Earth's surface energy budget and water cycle. Snow albedo is primarily controlled by snow grain properties (e.g., size and shape) and light-absorbing particles (LAPs) such as black carbon (BC) and dust. The mixing state of LAPs in snow also has impacts on LAP-induced snow albedo reduction and surface radiative forcing (RF). However, most land surface models assume that snow grain shape is spherical and LAPs are externally mixed with the snow grains. This study improves the snow radiative transfer model in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2.0 (E3SM v2.0) Land Model (ELM v2.0) by considering non-spherical snow grain shapes (i.e., spheroid, hexagonal plate, and Koch snowflake) and internal mixing of dust--snow, and it systematically evaluates the impacts on the surface energy budget and water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A series of ELM simulations with different treatments of snow grain shape, mixing state of BC--snow and dust--snow, and sub-grid topographic effects (TOP) on solar radiation are performed. Compared with two remote sensing snow products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the control ELM simulation (ELM\_Control) with the default configurations of spherical snow grain shape, internal mixing of BC--snow, external mixing of dust--snow, and without TOP as well as the ELM simulation with new model features (ELM\_New) can both capture the overall snow distribution reasonably. Additionally, ELM\_New overall shows smaller biases in snow cover fraction than ELM\_Control in spring when snowmelt is important for water management. The estimated LAP-induced RF in ELM\_New ranges from 0 to 19.3\hspace{0.167em}W\hspace{0.167em}m-2 with the area-weighted average value of 1.5\hspace{0.167em}W\hspace{0.167em}m-2 that is comparable to the reported values in existing studies. The Koch snowflake shape, among other non-spherical shapes, shows the largest difference from the spherical shape in spring when snow processes related to the surface energy budget and water cycle have high importance. The impacts of the mixing state of LAP in snow are smaller than the shape effects and depend on snow grain shape. Compared to external mixing, internal mixing of LAP--snow can lead to larger snow albedo reduction and snowmelt, which further affect the surface energy budget and water cycle. The individual contributions of non-spherical snow shape, mixing state of LAP--snow, and local topography impacts on the snow and surface fluxes have different signs and magnitudes, and their combined effects may be negative or positive due to complex and nonlinear interactions among the factors. Overall, the changes in net solar radiation in spring due to individual and combined effects range from -28.6 to 16.9\hspace{0.167em}W\hspace{0.167em}m-2 and -29.7 to 12.2\hspace{0.167em}W\hspace{0.167em}m-2, respectively. This study advances understanding of the role of snow grain shape and mixing state of LAP--snow in land surface processes and offers guidance for improving snow simulations and RF estimates in Earth system models under climate change.]]></p>},

	abstract = {<p> Snow albedo is highly variable over multiple temporal and spatial scales. This variability is more pronounced in areas that experience seasonal snowpack. Satellite retrievals, physically based models and parameterizations for snow albedo all require ground-based measurements for calibration, initialization, and validation. Ground measurements are generally made using upward and downward-facing pyranometers at opportunistically located weather stations that are sparsely distributed, particularly in mountainous regions. These station-based measurements cannot capture the spatial variability of albedo across the land surface. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with upward and downward-facing pyranometers provide near-surface measurements of broadband albedo that are spatially distributed across landscapes, offering improvements over <italic>in-situ</italic> sensors. At the hillslope to watershed scale albedo measurements from UAVs taken over heterogeneous terrain are a function of the spatial variability in albedo and topography within the downward-facing sensor's field-of-view (FOV). In this research we propose methods for topographic correction of UAV snow albedo measurements and comparison to gridded satellite albedo products. These methods account for the variability of surface topography and albedo within the sensor FOV, sensor tilt, and the angular response of pyranometers. We applied the proposed methodologies to UAV snow albedo measurements collected over an alpine meadow in southwest Montana, United States (45.23$\,^{\circ}$, -111.28$\,^{\circ}$). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effect of altering the processing FOV (PFOV) for both topographic corrections and comparison to coincident Landsat 8-derived albedo measurements. Validation from ground-based albedo measurements showed the topographic correction to reduce albedo measurement error considerably over mildly sloping terrain. Our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that outcomes from the topographic correction and satellite comparison are highly dependent on the specified PFOV. Based on field observations and analyses of UAV albedo measurements made at different altitudes, we provide guidelines for strategizing future UAV albedo surveys. This research presents considerable advances in the standardization of UAV-based albedo measurement. We establish the foundation for future research to utilize this platform to collect near-surface validation measurements over heterogeneous terrain with high accuracy and consistency. </p>},

	abstract = {The stability of the permanently installed terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) in a high mountain environment at Hintereisferner glacier, {\"O}tztal Alps, Austria, is tested. From previous studies it is already known that the uncertainty of the permanent setup results from scanning geometry, atmospheric conditions and instrumental limitations. This study focuses on the instrumental limitations related to the lack of perfect stability of the TLS. A case study is performed with hourly scans over the glacier and the data of the internal inclination sensors are read. A comparison of the scanning data with the inclination data shows that the TLS at Hintereisferner is affected by both high-frequency vibrations and coarser movements. The high-frequency vibrations cause radial stripes in the data, and cannot be corrected, as the internal inclinations sensors of the TLS measure at a frequency of 1 Hz, whereas pulses are emitted at effectively 23 kHz. The coarser movements are indicated by the measurement of roll and pitch with the internal inclination sensors and can be corrected by manually georeferencing the data.In order to complete the uncertainty assessment of a permanent long-range TLS system in a high mountain environment, future work will concentrate on the impact from the scanning geometry and from the atmospheric variables. The finalised uncertainty assessment is crucial to derive the smallest magnitude at which snow (re)distribution can be detected and, thus, significantly will improve the treatment of snow cover dynamics in future glacier mass balance research.},

This paper reviews the essential and the more recent completed studies in the topography and surface feature identification domain. Four areas, with respect to the suggested approaches, have been analyzed and discussed: the input data, the concepts of point cloud structure for applying ML, the ML techniques used, and the applications of ML on LiDAR data. Then, an overview is provided to underline the advantages and the disadvantages of this research axis. Despite the training data labelling problem, the calculation cost, and the undesirable shortcutting due to data downsampling, most of the proposed methods use supervised ML concepts to classify the downsampled LiDAR data. Furthermore, despite the occasional highly accurate results, in most cases the results still require filtering. In fact, a considerable number of adopted approaches use the same data structure concepts employed in image processing to profit from available informatics tools. Knowing that the LiDAR point clouds represent rich 3D data, more effort is needed to develop specialized processing tools.},

The impacts of algal pigment and community composition on surface darkening are still poorly understood. Here, we characterise glacier ice and snow algal pigment signatures on snow and bare ice surfaces and study their role in photophysiology and energy absorption on three glaciers in Southeast Greenland. Purpurogallin and astaxanthin esters dominated the glacier ice and snow algal pigment pools (mass ratios to chlorophyll a of 32 and 56, respectively). Algal biomass and pigments impacted chromophoric dissolved organic matter concentrations. Despite the effective absorption of astaxanthin esters at wavelengths where incoming irradiance peaks, the cellular energy absorption of snow algae was 95\% lower than anticipated from their pigmentation, due to pigment packaging. The energy absorption of glacier ice algae was consequently ~ 5 \texttimes{} higher. On bare ice, snow algae may have locally contributed up to 13\% to total biological radiative forcing, despite contributing 44\% to total biomass. Our results give new insights into the impact of algal community composition on bare ice energy absorption and biomass accumulation during snow melt.},

	abstract = {Surface mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has accelerated over the past decades, mainly due to enhanced surface melting and liquid water runoff in response to atmospheric warming. A large portion of runoff from the GrIS originates from exposure of the darker bare ice in the ablation zone when the overlying snow melts, where surface albedo plays a critical role in modulating the energy available for melting. In this regard, it is imperative to understand the processes governing albedo variability to accurately project future mass loss from the GrIS. Bare-ice albedo is spatially and temporally variable and contingent on non-linear feedbacks and the presence of light-absorbing constituents. An assessment of models aiming at simulating albedo variability and associated impacts on meltwater production is crucial for improving our understanding of the processes governing these feedbacks and, in turn, surface mass loss from Greenland. Here, we report the results of a comparison of the bare-ice extent and albedo simulated by the regional climate model Mod{\`e}le Atmosph{\'e}rique R{\'e}gional (MAR) with satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the GrIS below 70$\,^{\circ}$ N. Our findings suggest that MAR overestimates bare-ice albedo by 22.8 \% on average in this area during the 2000-2021 period with respect to the estimates obtained from MODIS. Using an energy balance model to parameterize meltwater production, we find this bare-ice albedo bias can lead to an underestimation of total meltwater production from the bare-ice zone below 70$\,^{\circ}$ N of 42.8 \% during the summers of 2000-2021.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2022.113119},
	abstract = {Glaciers in many parts of the world are reported to be undergoing a darkening process (decrease in surface albedo). This has multiple causes, including the presence of impurities (such as mineral dust, carbonaceous particles, algae and cryoconite), and debris. Also glacier melt can induce an albedo decrease by initiating a melt-albedo feedback cycle. The extent of this albedo decrease and its spatial variability in different mountain ranges however are poorly known. In this study, we assess albedo changes on a selection of Alpine glaciers (542 glaciers >0.1 km2) by deriving eight albedo metrics from MODIS MOD10A1 satellite observations over a time period of 20 years (2000--2019). Albedo metrics include the start and end of the ablation season and its length, calculated through the selection of a threshold (albedo = 0.4) to separate melting ice from snow. We further calculated the number of ice melt days, integral of the length of the ablation season, minimum annual albedo, mean summer albedo and mean annual albedo. We identified significant trends in all metrics for a large percentage of glacier cells. A negative trend in minimum albedo (-0.06 decade-1 on average) was identified for 56\% of glacier cells, and 70\% of glaciers; a positive trend in the length of season (+18 days decade-1 on average) was identified for 11\% of glacier cells and 19\% of glaciers. Changes in minimum albedo occur mostly around the glacier median elevation, while for other metrics (e.g. start and length of season) changes are more frequent at the glacier termini (i.e. below 25th elevation percentile). We further investigated the relationship between the metrics and climate (downscaled ERA5 reanalysis data) and topographic (ALOS AW3D30 DEM) variability; we found that average summer temperature and elevation are the most significant proxies for all metrics (maximum correlation = 0.40 between elevation and minimum albedo) compared to spring temperature and other topographic variables. Finally, we looked at the ability of the albedo metrics to represent annual and summertime glacier mass balance of 31 selected Alpine glaciers in the World Glacier Monitoring Service database, finding significant correlations between minimum and summertime albedo and annual mass balance (R2 = 0.44 for minimum albedo and 0.40 for summertime albedo using all observations). Considering individual glaciers, all showed significant correlations with minimum albedo, and some of them are strongly correlated (e.g. Argentiere: R2 = 0.84, Saint Sorlin R2 = 0.88). Our glacier phenology approach opens new perspectives for the remote sensing of alpine and polar glaciers.},

Ice sheet wet snow extent reached 46\%, a record high for the 15--31 August AMSR data since 2003. Heat-driven firn deflation averaged 0.14 $\pm$ 0.05 m at four accumulation area automatic weather stations (AWSs). Energy budget calculations from AWS data indicate that surface heating from rainfall is much smaller than from either the sensible, latent, net-longwave or solar energy fluxes. Sensitivity tests show that without the heat-driven snow-darkening, melt at 1,840 m would have totaled 28\% less. Similarly, at 1,270 m elevation, without the bare ice exposure, melting would have been 51\% less. Proglacial river discharge was the highest on record since 2006 for late August and confirms the melt-sustaining effect of the albedo feedback.},

The phototroph community on the ice surface mainly consisted of the glacier alga Ancylonema nordenskioldii and the cyanobacterium Phormidesmis priestleyi. The glacier alga appeared on the ice surface in late June, after which its abundance increased exponentially throughout the melting period. A logistic growth model designed for snow algal growth reproduced the measured exponential increases, suggesting that growth could be explained using the model as a function of the ice melting duration. Cyanobacteria appeared and their abundance increased in late July but did not change exponentially thereafter. The abundance of cyanobacteria was explained with an empirical model expressed as a function of the amount of mineral dust on the bare ice surface. Our numerical and empirical models for reproducing glacier algae and cyanobacteria could be useful for quantifying the albedo reduction caused by their growth and the melt rates of the Greenland ice sheet and glaciers in the future.},

Here we present new empirical optical properties for snow and ice algae and incorporate them in a radiative transfer model to investigate their impact on snow and ice surface albedo. We found ice algal cells to be more efficient absorbers than snow algal cells, but their blooms had comparable impact on surface albedo due to the different photic conditions of their habitats. We then used the model to reconstruct the effect of ice algae on bare ice albedo spectra collected at our field site in southern Greenland, where blooms dropped the albedo locally by between 3 and 43\%, equivalent to 1--10 L m of melted ice. Using the newly parametrized model, future studies could investigate biological albedo reduction and algal quantification from remote hyperspectral and multispectral imagery.},

	abstract = {Accurate modeling of cryospheric surface albedo is essential for our understanding of climate change as snow and ice surfaces regulate the global radiative budget and sea-level through their albedo and mass balance. Although significant progress has been made using physical principles to represent the dynamic albedo of snow, models of glacier ice albedo tend to be heavily parameterized and not explicitly connected with physical properties that govern albedo, such as the number and size of air bubbles, specific surface area (SSA), presence of abiotic and biotic light absorbing constituents (LACs), and characteristics of any overlying snow. Here, we introduce SNICAR-ADv4, an extension of the multi-layer two-stream delta-Eddington radiative transfer model with the adding-doubling solver that has been previously applied to represent snow and sea-ice spectral albedo. SNICAR-ADv4 treats spectrally resolved Fresnel reflectance and transmittance between overlying snow and higher-density glacier ice, scattering by air bubbles of varying sizes, and numerous types of LACs. SNICAR-ADv4 simulates a wide range of clean snow and ice broadband albedo (BBA), ranging from 0.88 for (30g\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}\ensuremath{\mu}m) fine-grain snow to 0.03 for bare and bubble-free ice under direct light. Our results indicate that representing ice with a density of 650g\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}kgg\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}m-3 as snow with no refractive Fresnel layer, as done previously, generally overestimates the BBA by an average of 0.058. However, because most naturally occurring ice surfaces are roughened "white ice", we recommend modeling a thin snow layer over bare ice simulations. We find optimal agreement with measurements by representing cryospheric media with densities less than 650g\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}kgg\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}m-3 as snow and larger-density media as bubbly ice with a Fresnel layer. SNICAR-ADv4 also simulates the non-linear albedo impacts from LACs with changing ice SSA, with peak impact per unit mass of LACs near SSAs of 0.1-0.01g\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}m2g\mbox{\texteuro}{}\textasciimacron{}kg-1. For bare, bubble-free ice, LACs actually increase the albedo. SNICAR-ADv4 represents smooth transitions between snow, firn, and ice surfaces and accurately reproduces measured spectral albedos of a variety of glacier surfaces. This work paves the way for adapting SNICAR-ADv4 to be used in land ice model components of Earth system models.},

	abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2--4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25--123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3--9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US\$ 12--71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

Here we use UAV imagery to attribute seven distinct surface types to observed albedo along a 25 km transect dissecting the western, ablating sector of the ice sheet. Our results demonstrate that distributed surface impurities---an admixture of dust, black carbon and pigmented algae---explain 73{\%} of the observed spatial variability in albedo and are responsible for the dark zone itself. Crevassing and supraglacial water also drive albedo reduction but due to their limited extent, explain just 12 and 15{\%} of the observed variability respectively. Cryoconite, concentrated in large holes or fluvial deposits, is the darkest surface type but accounts for <1{\%} of the area and has minimal impact. We propose that the ongoing emergence and dispersal of distributed impurities, amplified by enhanced ablation and biological activity, will drive future expansion of Greenland's dark zone.},

	abstract = {Abstract Snow and ice melt processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet are a key in Earth's energy balance and are acutely sensitive to climate change. Melting dynamics are directly related to a decrease in surface albedo, amongst others caused by the accumulation of light-absorbing particles (LAPs). Featuring unique spectral patterns, these accumulations can be mapped and quantified by imaging spectroscopy. We present first results for the retrieval of glacier ice properties from the spaceborne PRISMA imaging spectrometer by applying a recently developed simultaneous inversion of atmospheric and surface state using optimal estimation. The image analyzed in this study was acquired over the South-West margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet in late August 2020. The area is characterized by patterns of both clean and dark ice associated with a high amount of LAPs deposited on the surface. We present retrieval maps and uncertainties for grain size, liquid water, and algae concentration, as well as estimated reflectance spectra for different surface properties. We then show the feasibility of using imaging spectroscopy to interpret multiband sensor data to achieve high accuracy, frequently repeated observations of changing snow and ice conditions. For example, the impurity index calculated from multiband Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument measurements is dependent on dust particles, but we show that algae concentration alone can be predicted from this data with less than 20\% uncertainty. Our study evidences that present and upcoming orbital imaging spectroscopy missions such as PRISMA, Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission, and the Surface Biology and Geology designated observable, can significantly support research of melting ice sheets.},

This makes glacier algal assemblages, which are typically dominated by just three main species, a potentially important yet under-researched component of the global biosphere, carbon, and water cycles. This review synthesizes current knowledge on glacier algae phylogenetics, physiology, and ecology. We discuss their significance for the evolution of early land plants and highlight their impacts on the physical and chemical supraglacial environment including their role as drivers of positive feedbacks to climate warming, thereby demonstrating their influence on Earth's past and future. Four complementary research priorities are identified, which will facilitate broad advances in glacier algae research, including establishment of reliable culture collections, sequencing of glacier algae genomes, development of diagnostic biosignatures for remote sensing, and improved predictive modeling of glacier algae biological-albedo effects.},

Currently, meteorological sensor data monitoring and acquisition mainly relies on the automatic weather station (AWS), wireless sensor network, satellites, and airborne remote sensing, etc. However, these conventional methods have some insuperable deficiencies. Recent advances in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for scientific use make drones easily overcome some of the paucity generated by these means. UAV as a sensor bearing platform can be used to collect sensor data in a more responsive, timely, three dimensional, and cost-effective manners. By implementing sensor network alike methods, drones can simulate the mobile ad-hoc networks in a mission and reduce the communication energy cost between each sensor node. This paper first demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, then proposes a sensor bearing framework aiming to bridge UAV remote sensing technique and customised meteorological sensor. A system prototype is developed and some real-world field tests indicate the application of the proposed framework is practical.},

	abstract = {[1] Ground-penetrating radar profiles at 100 MHz have been collected over an englacial channel system on the cold-ice glacier austre Broggerbreen, Svalbard. Analysis and synthetic modeling of the travel times and waveforms of the reflections from the channel have shown that after a near-vertical drop of similar to45 m in a moulin, the watercourse flows similar to900 m subhorizontally. The size of the conduit varies from a large semicircular channel, similar to5 m wide at its base close to the moulin, to a vertically elongated similar to2.5 m high channel close to the outlet. Variations in the depth of water along the channel have been calculated to be between 14 and 90\% of the channel height using detailed analysis of waveforms. The low channel gradient (<2\&DEG;) and results of dye-tracing experiments suggest that there is a significant degree of ponding along the channel length. This channel geometry was probably created during a period of increased crevassing from the Little Ice Age. A descent into the moulin provided direct observations of the channel dimensions close to the moulin and helped verify the interpretations and conclusions drawn from the study. Thus radar reflections can be successfully used to determine the depth, dimensions, and water content of englacial watercourses due to the transparency of ice to radar signals and the strong contrast in velocity between water, ice, and air. This technique offers exciting possibilities for the remote monitoring of englacial channels from the glacier surface.},

	abstract = {The size distribution of insoluble microparticles (dust) in the particle size interval 0.4-6.0 mu m radius has been measured in more than 1400 samples from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) deep ice core from Summit, Greenland. The samples were taken from ice core segments representing 32 climatic periods including ice from the Eem interglacial and ice from below the Eemian ice. The mean dust volume distributions from the climatic periods are compared, and the relationship of total dust mass to the concentration of Ca2+ and to the stable isotopic composition (delta(18)O) is investigated. The dust volume distributions are found to be lognormal in the size interval 0.4-2.0 mu m with nearly identical shapes. Changes of the lognormal part of the volume distributions are found to be connected to the total dust mass in a systematic way. The total dust mass is correlated to the Ca2+ concentration, and data do not show any enrichment in Ca2+ from exposed continental shelves due to lower sea levels during the last glacial maximum. The total dust mass is strongly connected to delta(18)O. The volume distribution of the particles in the size interval 2.0-6.0 mu m is found to be almost the same in most periods. The exceptions are the ''cold'' periods in the last part of the last glacial period, where the volume of these particles is higher than in most periods, and the periods from the Eemian and just above the Eemian where the volume of these particles is lower. The volume distributions of both the Eemian ''warm'' periods and the ''cold'' Eemian events are different from the distributions in ice from both below and above the Eemian ice. Climate changes appear to have modified the processes of production, transport, modification, and deposition of the dust aerosol in the same way over the last 120,000 years or more.},

This paper integrates perspectives from meteorologists, climatologists, statisti-cians, and hydrologists to identify generic end user (in particular , impact modeler) needs and to discuss downscaling capabilities and gaps. End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities and temporal and spatial variability , as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscal-ing, we review perfect prognosis statistical downscaling, model output statistics, and weather generators, focusing on recent developments to improve the representation of space-time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, subdaily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in small-scale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model.

However, local winds are considerably affected by topography, which global numerical weather models, due to their limited resolution, are not able to reproduce. To improve the skill of numerical weather models, statistical and data analysis methods can be used. Machine learning techniques can be applied to train a model with data coming from both the model and observations in the area of interest. In this paper, a new method based on nonparametric multivariate locally weighted regression is studied for improving the forecasted wind speed of a numerical weather model. Wind direction data are used to build different regression models, as a way of accounting for the effect of surrounding topography. The use of this technique offers similar levels of accuracy for wind speed forecasts compared with other machine learning algorithms with the advantage of being more intuitive and easy to interpret.},

A particular emphasis is placed on predictive anisotropy, a phenomenon referring to unequal predictability of surface wind components in different directions. Simulated predictability by comprehensive models is generally close to that found in observations in flat regions of NAM and EMB, but it is overestimated relative to observations in mountainous terrain. Simulated predictability in EAS shows different structures. In particular, there are regions in EAS where predictability simulated by RCMs is lower than that in observations. Overestimation of predictability by comprehensive models tends to occur in regions of low predictability in observations and can be attributed to small-scale physical processes not resolved by comprehensive models. An idealized mathematical model is used to characterize the predictability of wind components. It is found that the signal strength along the direction of minimum predictability is the dominant control on the strength of predictive anisotropy. The biases in the model representation of the statistical relationship between free-tropospheric circulation and surface winds are interpreted in terms of inadequate simulation of small-scale processes in regional and global models, and the primary cause of predictive anisotropy is attributed to such small-scale processes.},

In complex terrain, the coupled model reproduces the measured vertical profiles of horizontal wind speed better than the standalone microscale model or the mesoscale model. The coupled model also performs better in the horizontal extrapolation of measurements in complex terrain.

Simulations show that dust from meltout is the main source of impurity mass at the melting glacier ice surface, and current rates of atmospheric deposition of dust play only a minor role. However, for BC the atmospheric deposition is the main source where ice melt rates are below 1 m, and atmospheric deposition is most likely from intercontinental transport due to the scarce population and lack of forests in Greenland.},

For example, at Dye 3, Greenland, enhancement factors of 3-4 are needed in order to explain the rate of borehole tilting. Previous authors have identified crystal fabric as the dominant contributor, but the role of impurities and crystal size is still incompletely resolved. Here we use two formulations of anisotropic flow laws for ice (Azuma's and Sachs' models) to account for the effects of anisotropy, and show that: the measured anisotropy of the ice at Dye 3 cannot explain all the detailed variations in the measured strain rates. The jump in enhancement across the Holocene-Wisconsin boundary is larger than expected from the measured fabrics alone. Dust and soluble-ion concentration divided by crystal size correlates well with the residual enhancement, indicating that most of the "excess deformation" may be due to impurities or crystal size. While the major features of the deformation at Dye 3 are explained by anisotropy and temperature, results also suggest that further research into the role of impurities and crystal size is warranted.},

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the efficacy of estimating wind speed and direction with 1) a direct approach using a sonic anemometer mounted on top of a hexacopter and 2) an indirect approach using attitude data from a quadcopter. The data are collected by the multirotor aircraft hovering 10 m above ground adjacent to one or more sonic anemometers. Wind speed and direction show good agreement with sonic anemometer measurements in the initial experiments. Typical errors in wind speed and direction are smaller than 0.5 and 30$\,^{\circ}$, respectively. Multirotor aircraft provide a promising alternative to traditional platforms for vertical profiling in the atmospheric boundary layer, especially in conditions where a tethered balloon system is typically deployed.},

Here we assess future abatement strategies in terms of how much they reduce the climate impact of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) from contained combustion. We develop global scenarios which take into account regional differences in climate impact, costs of abatement and ability to pay, as well as both the direct and indirect (snow-albedo) climate impact of BC and OC. To represent the climate impact, we estimate consistent region-specific values of direct and indirect global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP). The indirect GWP has been estimated using a physical approach and includes the effect of change in albedo from BC deposited on snow. The indirect GWP is highest in the Middle East followed by Russia, Europe and North America, while the total GWP is highest in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. We conclude that prioritizing emission reductions in Asia represents the most cost-efficient global abatement strategy for BC because Asia is (1) responsible for a large share of total emissions, (2) has lower abatement costs compared to Europe and North America and (3) has large health cobenefits from reduced PM 10 emissions.

	abstract = {Paleoclimatic records show that the Greenland Ice Sheet consistently has lost mass in response to warming, and grown in response to cooling. Such changes have occurred even at times of slow or zero sea-level change, so changing sea level cannot have been the cause of at least some of the ice-sheet changes. In contrast, there are no documented major ice-sheet changes that occurred independent of temperature changes. Moreover, snowfall has increased when the climate warmed, but the ice sheet lost mass nonetheless: increased accumulation in the ice sheet's center has not been sufficient to counteract increased melting and flow near the edges. Most documented forcings and ice-sheet responses spanned periods of several thousand years, but limited data also show rapid response to rapid forcings. In particular, regions near the ice margin have responded within decades. However, major changes of central regions of the ice sheet are thought to require centuries to millennia. The paleoclimatic record does not yet strongly constrain how rapidly a major shrinkage or nearly complete loss of the ice sheet could occur. The evidence suggests nearly total ice-sheet loss may result from warming of more than a few degrees above mean 20th century values, but this threshold is poorly defined (perhaps as little as 2 degrees C or more than 7 degrees C). Paleoclimatic records are sufficiently sketchy that the ice sheet may have grown temporarily in response to warming, or changes may have been induced by factors other than temperature, without having been recorded.

	abstract = {Albedo is the dominant factor governing surface melt variability in the ablation area of ice sheets and glaciers. Aerosols such as mineral dust and black carbon (soot) accumulate on the ice surface and cause a darker surface and therefore a lower albedo. The darkening effect on the ice surface is currently not included in sea level projections, and the effect is unknown. We present a model framework which includes ice dynamics, aerosol transport, aerosol accumulation and the darkening effect on ice albedo and its consequences for surface melt. The model is applied to a simplified geometry resembling the conditions of the Greenland ice sheet, and it is forced by several temperature scenarios to quantify the darkening effect of aerosols on future mass loss. The effect of aerosols depends non-linearly on the temperature rise due to the feedback between aerosol accumulation and surface melt. According to our conceptual model, accounting for black carbon and dust in future projections of ice sheet changes until the year 3000 could induce an additional volume loss of 7 \%. Since we have ignored some feedback processes, the impact might be even larger.},

A convolutional neural network is trained on a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are generated up to 700\texttimes{} faster than re-simulating the data with the underlying CPU solver, while achieving compression rates of up to 1300\texttimes{}.},

	abstract = {One of the primary controls upon the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is albedo, a measure of how much solar radiation that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed. Lower-albedo snow and ice surfaces therefore warm more quickly. There is a major difference in the albedo of snow-covered versus bare-ice surfaces, but observations also show that there is substantial spatio-temporal variability of up to $\sim$ 0.4 in bare-ice albedo. Variability in bare-ice albedo has been attributed to a number of processes including the accumulation of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) and the changing physical properties of the nearsurface ice. However, the combined impact of these processes upon albedo remains poorly constrained. Here we use field observations to show that pigmented glacier algae are ubiquitous and cause surface darkening both within and outside the south-west GrIS "dark zone" but that other factors including modification of the ice surface by algal bloom presence, surface topography and weathering crust state are also important in determining patterns of daily albedo variability. We further use observations from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to examine the scale gap in albedo between ground versus remotely sensed measurements made by Sentinel-2 (S-2) and MODIS. S-2 observations provide a highly conservative estimate of algal bloom presence because algal blooms occur in patches much smaller than the ground resolution of S-2 data. Nevertheless, the bare-ice albedo distribution at the scale of 20m\texttimes{}20m S-2 pixels is generally unimodal and unskewed. Conversely, bare-ice surfaces have a left-skewed albedo distribution at MODIS MOD10A1 scales. Thus, when MOD10A1 observations are used as input to energy balance modelling, meltwater production can be underestimated by $\sim$ 2 \%. Our study highlights that (1) the impact of the weathering crust state is of similar importance to the direct darkening role of light-absorbing impurities upon ice albedo and (2) there is a spatial-scale dependency in albedo measurement which reduces detection of real changes at coarser resolutions.},

	journal = {Monthly Weather Review},
	abstract = {An efficient method is proposed for performing the grid interpolations required at each advective time step of a multilevel, limited-area semi-Lagrangian model. The distinctive feature of the method is that it is composed of a cascade of one-dimensional interpolations of entire fields of data through a sequence of intermediate grids. These intermediate grids are formed as hybrid combinations of the standard model grid coordinates, which, together with the Lagrangian coordinates, are delineated by the origins of the trajectories that characterize the semi-Lagrangian method.When applied at Nth-order accuracy, the cascade method requires only O(N) operations compared with O(N3) for the conventional three-dimensional interpolation methods, making the adoption of high-order schemes attractive.The technique was tested on a large number (100) of 48-h forecasts and was found to be as accurate as the conventional interpolation procedures based on point-by-point Cartesian products of one-dimensional interpolators. However, the cascade interpolation technique was 2.9, 6.1, and 10.2 times as fast as the conventional interpolation scheme for fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order, respectively.We observe that the cascade method is equally applicable to the problem of interpolation from the grid of termini of forward trajectories to the standard model grid, for which there is no obvious counterpart in the Cartesian product method. Our technique therefore opens the way to a whole new class of high-order accurate semi-Lagrangian methods that incorporate the use of forward trajectories as part of the time-stepping process.},

This limitation is derived from the use of low-resolution and grid-box averaged data. In this paper a dynamical downscaling method is presented to increase the local accuracy of wind speed forecasts. The proposed method divides the wind speed forecasting into two steps. In the first one, the mesoscale model WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) is used for getting wind speed forecasts at specific points of the study domain. On a second stage, these values are used for feeding the HDWind microscale model. HDWind is a local model that provides both a high-resolution wind field that covers the entire study domain and values of wind speed and direction at very located points. As an example of use of the proposed method, we calculate a high-resolution wind field in an urban-interface area from Badajoz, a South-West Spanish city located near the Portugal border. The results obtained are compared with the values read by a weathervane tower of the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) in order to prove that the microscale model improves the forecasts obtained by the mesoscale model.},

	abstract = {A global assessment of precipitation chemistry and deposition has been carried out under the direction of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Scientific Advisory Group for Precipitation Chemistry (SAG-PC). The assessment addressed three questions: (1) what do measurements and model estimates of precipitation chemistry and wet, dry and total deposition of sulfur, nitrogen, sea salt, base cations, organic acids, acidity, and phosphorus show globally and regionally? (2) has the wet deposition of major ions changed since 2000 (and, where information and data are available, since 1990) and (3) what are the major gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge? To that end, regionally-representative measurements for two 3-year-averaging periods, 2000-2002 and 2005-2007, were compiled worldwide. Data from the 2000-2002 averaging period were combined with 2001 ensemble-mean modeling results from 21 global chemical transport models produced in Phase 1 of the Coordinated Model Studies Activities of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP). The measurement data and modeling results were used to generate global and regional maps of major ion concentrations in precipitation and deposition. A major product of the assessment is a database of quality assured ion concentration and wet deposition data gathered from regional and national monitoring networks. The database is available for download from the World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry (http://wdcpc.org/). The assessment concludes that global concentrations and deposition of sulfur and nitrogen are reasonably well characterized with levels generally highest near emission sources and more than an order of magnitude lower in areas largely free of anthropogenic influences. In many parts of the world, wet deposition of reduced nitrogen exceeds that of oxidized nitrogen and is increasing. Sulfur and nitrogen concentrations and deposition in North America and Europe have declined significantly in line with emission reduction policies. Major regions of the world, including South America, the more remote areas of North America, much of Asia, Africa, Oceania, polar regions, and all of the oceans, are inadequately sampled for all of the major ions in wet and dry deposition, and particularly so for phosphorus, organic forms of nitrogen, and weak acids including carbonates and organic acids. Measurement-based inferential estimates of dry deposition are limited to sulfur and some nitrogen in only a few regions of the world and methods are highly uncertain. The assessment concludes with recommendations to address major gaps and uncertainties in global ion concentration and deposition measurements. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

	abstract = {A forward-trajectory semi-Lagrangian scheme for advection on the surface of the sphere is proposed. The advection scheme utilizes the forward (downstream) trajectory originating at Eulerian grid points and cascade interpolation, a sequence of I D interpolations, to transfer data from the downstream Lagrangian points to the Eulerian points. A new and more accurate algorithm determines pole values. The resulting forward-trajectory semi-Lagrangian scheme can easily incorporate high-order trajectory integration methods. This avoids the standard iterative process in a typical backward-trajectory scheme. Two third-order accurate schemes and a second-order accurate scheme are presented. A mass-conservative version of the forward-trajectory semi-Lagrangian scheme is also derived within the cascade interpolation framework. Mass from a Lagrangian cell is transferred to the corresponding Eulerian cell with two ID remappings through an intermediate cell system. Mass in the polar region is redistributed by way of an efficient local approximation. The resulting scheme is globally conservative, but restricted to meridional Courant number, C-0 less than or equal to 1. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The multichannel microwave radiometer (MMWR) provides continuous temperature and humidity profiles. We demonstrate a method for profile bias correction that significantly improves vertical temperature (T) and water vapor density ($\delta$wv) profile accuracy.We compared MMWR temperature (TRD) and humidity ($\delta$wvRD) profiles during winter in the Sierra of Guadarrama (Madrid) at 1150m altitude with thousands of radiosonde temperature (TRW) and humidity ($\delta$wvRW) soundings from a launch site at 610m altitude and 50km distance. In spite of relatively large horizontal and vertical separation between the two sites, sounding differences above the boundary layer are comparable to observation error typically assigned to radiosonde soundings when they are assimilated into numerical weather models. Systematic bias between the paired values of TRW and TRD and $\delta$wvRW and $\delta$wvRD ranges from 0.2 to 1.2K and 0.05 to 0.5gm-3. This bias can be removed using a corrector function that is applied at each T and $\delta$wv level. Using this method, the bias for both variables is reduced to insignificant levels and their accuracy is significantly improved. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The paper includes a detailed description of the technical and practical aspects that went into running the mesoscale simulations and the downscaling using WAsP. We show the main results from the final wind atlas and present a comprehensive evaluation of each component of the NEWA model chain using observations from a large set of tall masts located all over Europe. The added value of the WRF and WAsP downscaling of wind climatologies is evaluated relative to the performance of the driving ERA5 reanalysis and shows that the WRF downscaling reduces the mean wind speed bias and spread relative to that of ERA5 from -1:50 $\pm$ 1:30 to 0:02 $\pm$ 0:78 m s-1. The WAsP downscaling has an added positive impact relative to that of the WRF model in simple terrain. In complex terrain, where the assumptions of the linearized flow model break down, both the mean bias and spread in wind speed are worse than those from the raw mesoscale results.},

	abstract = {The increasing size of wind turbines, with rotors already spanning more than 150 m diameter and hub heights above 100 m, requires proper modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) from the surface to the free atmosphere. Furthermore, large wind farm arrays create their own boundary layer structure with unique physics. This poses significant challenges to traditional wind engineering models that rely on surface-layer theories and engineering wind farm models to simulate the flow in and around wind farms. However, adopting an ABL approach offers the opportunity to better integrate wind farm design tools and meteorological models. The challenge is how to build the bridge between atmospheric and wind engineering model communities and how to establish a comprehensive evaluation process that identifies relevant physical phenomena for wind energy applications with modeling and experimental requirements. A framework for model verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification is established to guide this process by a systematic evaluation of the modeling system at increasing levels of complexity. In terms of atmospheric physics, `building the bridge' means developing models for the so-called `terra incognita,' a term used to designate the turbulent scales that transition from mesoscale to microscale. This range of scales within atmospheric research deals with the transition from parameterized to resolved turbulence and the improvement of surface boundary-layer parameterizations. The coupling of meteorological and wind engineering flow models and the definition of a formal model evaluation methodology, is a strong area of research for the next generation of wind conditions assessment and wind farm and wind turbine design tools. Some fundamental challenges are identified in order to guide future research in this area. WIREs Energy Environ 2017, 6:e214. doi: 10.1002/wene.214.

	abstract = {This study presents the development of a method to statistically downscale daily wind speed variations in an extended Great Lakes region. A probabilistic approach is used, predicting a daily-varying probability density function (PDF) of local-scale daily wind speed conditioned on large-scale daily wind speed predictors. Advantages of a probabilistic method are that it provides realistic information on the variance and extremes in addition to information on the mean, it allows the autocorrelation of downscaled realizations to be tuned to match the autocorrelation of local-scale observations, and it allows flexibility in the use of the final downscaled product. Much attention is given to fitting the proper functional form of the PDF by investigating the observed local-scale wind speed distribution (predictand) as a function of the decile of the large-scale wind (predictor). It is found that the local-scale standard deviation and the local-scale shape parameter (from a gamma distribution) are nonconstant functions of the large-scale predictor. As such, a vector generalized linear model is developed to relate the large-scale and local-scale wind speeds. Maximum likelihood and cross validation are used to fit local-scale gamma distribution shape and scale parameters to the large-scale wind speed. The result is a daily-varying probability distribution of local-scale wind speed, conditioned on the large-scale wind speed. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Wind data collection in the atmospheric boundary layer benefits from short-Term wind speed measurements using unmanned aerial vehicles. Fixed-wing and rotary-wing devices with diverse anemometer technology have been used in the past to provide such data, but the accuracy still has the potential to be increased. A lightweight drone for carrying an industry-standard precision sonic anemometer was developed. Accuracy tests have been performed with the isolated anemometer at high tilt angles in a calibration wind tunnel, with the drone flying in a large wind tunnel and with the full system flying at different heights next to a bistatic lidar reference. The propeller-induced flow deflects the air to some extent, but this effect is compensated effectively. The data fusion shows a substantial reduction of crosstalk (factor of 13) between ground speed and wind speed. When compared with the bistatic lidar in very turbulent conditions, with a 10 s averaging interval and with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) constantly circling around the measurement volume of the lidar reference, wind speed measurements have a bias between-2.0 \% and 4.2 \% (root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.3 \% to 15.5 \%), vertical wind speed bias is between-0.05 and 0.07 m s-1 (RMSE of 0.15 to 0.4 m s-1), elevation bias is between-1 and 0.7$\,^{\circ}$ (RMSE of 1.2 to 6.3$\,^{\circ}$ ), and azimuth bias is between-2.6 and 7.2$\,^{\circ}$ (RMSE of 2.6 to 8.0$\,^{\circ}$ ). Key requirements for good accuracy under challenging and dynamic conditions are the use of a full-size sonic anemometer, a large distance between anemometer and propellers, and a suitable algorithm for reducing the effect of propeller-induced flow. The system was finally flown in the wake of a wind turbine, successfully measuring the spatial velocity deficit and downwash distribution during forward flight, yielding results that are in very close agreement to lidar measurements and the theoretical distribution. We believe that the results presented in this paper can provide important information for designing flying systems for precise air speed measurements either for short duration at multiple locations (battery powered) or for long duration at a single location (power supplied via cable). UAVs that are able to accurately measure three-dimensional wind might be used as a cost-effective and flexible addition to measurement masts and lidar scans.},

Besides, a compact inverted-F antenna for GPS L1 Band with the central frequency of 1575.42 MHz is designed, and integrated into the interval between the sections of the sectorial antenna array. The radiation arm of the inverted-F is spiralled to 0.024 -gps \texttimes{} 0.05 gps (: Free space wavelength) to fit into the limited space. An omnidirectional pattern with 1 dBi realized gain derived from simulated results shows a desired radiation efficiency.

	doi = {10.5194/wes-5-997-2020},
	abstract = {This paper describes a method for reducing the uncertainty associated with utilizing fully numerical models for wind resource assessment in the early stages of project development. The presented method is based on a combination of numerical weather predictions (NWPs) and microscale downscaling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to predict the local wind resource. Numerical modelling is (at least) 2 orders of magnitude less expensive and time consuming compared to conventional measurements. As a consequence, using numerical methods could enable a wind project developer to evaluate a larger number of potential sites before making an investment. This would likely increase the chances of finding the best available projects. A technique is described, multiple transfer location analysis (MTLA), where several different locations for performing the data transfer between the NWP and the CFD model are evaluated. Independent CFD analyses are conducted for each evaluated data transfer location. As a result, MTLA will generate multiple independent observations of the data transfer between the NWP and the CFD model. This results in a reduced uncertainty in the data transfer, but more importantly MTLA will identify locations where the result of the data transfer deviates from the neighbouring locations. This will enable further investigation of the outliers and give the analyst a possibility to correct erroneous predictions. The second part is found to reduce the number and magnitude of large deviations in the numerical predictions relative to the reference measurements. The Modern Energy Wind Assessment Model (ME-WAM) with and without MTLA is validated against field measurements. The validation sample for ME-WAM without MTLA consists of 35 observations and gives a mean bias of -0.10 ms-1 and a SD of 0.44 ms-1. ME-WAM with MTLA is validated against a sample of 45 observations, and the mean bias is found to be C0.05 ms-1 with a SD of 0.26 ms-1. After adjusting for the composition of the two samples with regards to the number of sites in complex terrain, the reduction in variability achieved by MTLA is quantified to 11 \% of the SD for non-complex sites and 35 \% for complex sites.},

Blooms of pigmented glacier ice algae lower ice albedo and accelerate surface melting in the ice sheet's southwest sector. Although glacier ice algae cause up to 13\% of the surface melting in this region, the controls on bloom development remain poorly understood. Here we show a direct link between mineral phosphorus in surface ice and glacier ice algae biomass through the quantification of solid and fluid phase phosphorus reservoirs in surface habitats across the southwest ablation zone of the ice sheet. We demonstrate that nutrients from mineral dust likely drive glacier ice algal growth, and thereby identify mineral dust as a secondary control on ice sheet melting.},

Significant changes are made to nearly all spectral regions. The blue and near- ultraviolet absorption is much weaker than the prior estimates, which were already very small. The near- infrared absorption coefficient differs by as much as a factor of 2 from the prior compilation at some wavelengths. The midinfrared absorption coefficient is rather uncertain in the weakly absorbing regions near 9 and 20 mm. New far- infrared measurements at low temperatures are extrapolated to higher temperatures, which shifts the peak positions. New microwave measurements find absorption much weaker than previously reported, by factors of 2 - 5. The real part of the index of refraction is computed using Kramers- Kronig analysis; it differs from the prior compilation only in the far infrared. Tables of the revised optical constants are available on a website.},

We reconstruct past accumulation rates, that are larger than those modelled using the classical vapour saturation pressure relationship during glacial periods by up to a factor 1.5. During the Early Holocene, changes in reconstructed accumulation are not linearly related to changes in ice isotopic composition. A simple model of past elevation changes is developed and shows an amplitude variation of 110-120m at both sites. We suggest that there is basal melting at Dome C ( 0.56 +/- 0.19 mm/yr). The reconstructed velocity profile is highly non-linear at both sites, which suggests complex ice flow effects. This induces a non-linear thinning function in both drilling sites, which is also characterized by bumps corresponding to variations in ice thickness with time.},

	abstract = {The earths cryosphere, which includes snow, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, ice shelves, sea ice, river and lake ice, and permafrost, contains about 75\% of the earths fresh water. It exists at almost all latitudes, from the tropics to the poles, and plays a vital role in controlling the global climate system. It also provides direct visible evidence of the effect of climate change, and, therefore, requires proper understanding of its complex dynamics. This encyclopedia mainly focuses on the various aspects of snow, ice and glaciers, but also covers other cryospheric branches, and provides up-to-date information and basic concepts on relevant topics. It includes alphabetically arranged and professionally written, comprehensive and authoritative academic articles by well-known international experts in individual fields. The encyclopedia contains a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from the atmospheric processes responsible for snow formation; transformation of snow to ice and changes in their properties; classification of ice and glaciers and their worldwide distribution; glaciation and ice ages; glacier dynamics; glacier surface and subsurface characteristics; geomorphic processes and landscape formation; hydrology and sedimentary systems; permafrost degradation; hazards caused by cryospheric changes; and trends of glacier retreat on the global scale along with the impact of climate change. This book can serve as a source of reference at the undergraduate and graduate level and help to better understand snow, ice and glaciers. It will also be an indispensable tool containing specialized literature for geologists, geographers, climatologists, hydrologists, and water resources engineers; as well as for those who are engaged in the practice of agricultural and civil engineering, earth sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, ecosystem management, and other relevant subjects.},

	abstract = {Due to a lack of environment awareness, today's low-altitude fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are limited to primitively follow user-defined waypoints. All high-level decision making is still performed by a human user. Fully-autonomous remote missions in complex environments however require true environment awareness both with respect to terrain and wind. While terrain-aware navigation is covered in existing literature, the real-time estimation and consideration of complex wind patterns onboard UAVs is not. This paper therefore presents the literature's first-ever local 3D wind field prediction method which can run in real time onboard a UAV. The selected method is a simple downscaling approach which retrieves low-resolution data from global weather models and then adjusts the wind field via potential flow theory such that terrain boundaries, mass conservation, and the atmospheric stratification are observed. Typical 3D wind fields of 1 km3 volume are calculated in below 10 seconds. Synthetic test cases such as the flow around a semi-cylinder, through a valley and over a ramp yield good results. A comparison with 3D LIDAR wind data collected over 10 days in the Swiss Alps shows an overall wind error reduction of 23\% with respect to the zero-wind assumption that is mostly used for UAV path planning today. Overall, our initial research demonstrates the feasibility of real-time 3D wind field prediction onboard a UAV. However, the focus on low computation time means that the vertical wind prediction lacks accuracy. The paper therefore ends with a research outlook into real-time 3D wind field prediction through the fusion of machine learning techniques with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper a combined physical-statistical approach for the downscaling of model wind speed is assessed. The key factor in this approach is the decomposition of the total error (model - observation) into a small-scale representation mismatch (RM) and a large-scale model error (ME). The RM is caused by the difference between the grid-box mean conditions of the model and the locally valid conditions. For wind speed, the RM is primarily determined by the difference in roughness between the model and the location. In the first step of the combined approach. the physical method (based on surface layer theory) adjusts the model output for the roughness characteristics at several observation sites. For these local wind estimates the RM is strongly reduced but the ME remains. To reduce this ME, the local wind estimates, together with the corresponding observations, are used in one pool to derive one linear regression equation. With local roughness length information derived from land-use maps, this regression equation can then be applied to model output to produce high-resolution wind speed fields. Using a 3-yr dataset, the combined approach is validated at six independent stations in the Netherlands (with different RMs). In this way, it is shown that for observation-free locations the combined approach results in a significant improvement in skill compared to the standard model output as well as the physical method only. The method can be optimized for special conditions, such as high wind speed cases. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

The samples were analyzed for spectrally-resolved visible light absorption. For surface snow, the average mass mixing ratio of BC was 15 ng/g in northern Chile (18--33$\,^{\circ}$S), 28 ng/g near Santiago (a major city near latitude 33$\,^{\circ}$S, where urban pollution plays a significant role), and 13 ng/g in southern Chile (33--41$\,^{\circ}$S). The regional average vertically-integrated loading of BC was 207 \mathrm{\mu}g/m 2 in the north, 780 \mathrm{\mu}g/m 2 near Santiago, and 2500 \mathrm{\mu}g/m 2 in the south, where the snow season was longer and the snow was deeper. For samples collected at locations where there had been no new snowfall for a week or more, the BC concentration in surface snow was high (--100 ng/g) and the sub-surface snow was comparatively clean, indicating the dominance of dry deposition of BC. Mean albedo reductions due to light-absorbing impurities were 0.0150, 0.0160, and 0.0077 for snow grain radii of 100 \mathrm{\mu}m for northern Chile, the region near Santiago, and southern Chile; respective mean radiative forcings for the winter months were 2.8, 1.4, and 0.6 W/m 2 .

	abstract = {The melting of glaciers and ice sheets is nowadays considered a symbol of climate change. Many complex mechanisms are involved in the melting of ice, and, among these processes, surface darkening due to organic material on bare ice has recently received attention from the scientific community. The presence of microbes on glaciers has been shown to decrease the albedo of ice and promote melting. Despite several studies from the Himalaya, Greenland, Andes, and Alaska, no quantitative studies have yet been conducted in the European Alps. In this paper, we made use of DNA sequencing, microscopy and field spectroscopy to describe the nature of glacier algae found at a glacier (Vadret da Morteratsch) of the European Alps and to evaluate their effect on the ice-albedo feedback. Among different algal species identified in the samples, we found a remarkable abundance of Ancylonema nordenskioeldii, a species that has never previously been quantitatively documented in the Alps and that dominates algal blooms on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results show that, at the end of the ablation season, the concentration of Ancylonema nordenskioeldii on the glacier surface is higher than that of other algal species (i.e. Mesotaenium berggrenii). Using field spectroscopy data, we identified a significant correlation between a reflectance ratio (750 nm/650 nm) and the algae concentration. This reflectance ratio could be useful for future mapping of glacier algae from remote sensing data exploiting band 6 (740 nm) and band 4 (665 nm) of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2 satellite. Here we show that the biological darkening of glaciers (i.e. the bioalbedo feedback) is also occurring in the European Alps, and thus it is a global process that must be taken into account when considering the positive feedback mechanisms related to glacier melting.},

	journal = {Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society},
	abstract = {Orography is incorporated into two global shallow-water numerical models, the first (which is termed the (u, v) model) based on a semi-Lagrangian vector discretization of the momentum equation, the second (which is termed the PV-D model) based on the semi-Lagrangian advection of potential vorticity. Both models are two-time-level and use the finite-difference approach.Linear analyses of both models are performed for the idealized situation of stationary flow over orography on an f-plane. In extension of the analysis of Rivest et al. the effects of spatial discretization are included. Spurious orographic resonance in the sense of infinite amplitude is eliminated by the damping effects of spatial interpolation, but spurious enhanced responses in the neighbourhood of the points at which resonance previously occurred still remain. The linear analyses indicate similar spurious enhanced responses for both models, which is confirmed by the numerical experiments.The spurious orographic noise in both models can be eliminated by a sufficient amount of uncentring, though it is shown that uncentring of either first order or second order can have negative impacts on the large-scale Rossby waves. The PV-D model formulation, however, allows the use of a scheme in which only the divergence and continuity equations are uncentred, which minimizes such negative impacts.},

We evaluate the downscaling quality of four exemplary CNN architectures and compare these against a multilinear regression model. We conduct a qualitative and quantitative comparison of model predictions and examine whether the predictive skill of CNNs can be enhanced by incorporating additional atmospheric variables, such as geopotential height and forecast surface roughness, or static high-resolution fields, like land--sea mask and topography. We further propose DeepRU, a novel U-Net-based CNN architecture, which is able to infer situation-dependent wind structures that cannot be reconstructed by other models. Inferring a target 9 km resolution wind field from the low-resolution input fields over the Alpine area takes less than 10 ms on our graphics processing unit target architecture, which compares favorably to an overhead in simulation time of minutes or hours between low- and high-resolution forecast simulations.},

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise in recent decades1,2, and it is expected to continue to be so3. Although increases in glacier flow4--6 and surface melting7--9 have been driven by oceanic10--12 and atmospheric13,14 warming, the magnitude and trajectory of the ice sheet's mass imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet's volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. The ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, but annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 345 $\pm$ 66 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,902 $\pm$ 342 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.8 $\pm$ 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that the reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,964 $\pm$ 565 billion tonnes (50.3 per cent) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,938 $\pm$ 541 billion tonnes (49.7 per cent) of ice loss was due to increased glacier dynamical imbalance, which rose from 46 $\pm$ 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 $\pm$ 25 billion tonnes per year since then. The total rate of ice loss slowed to 222 $\pm$ 30 billion tonnes per year between 2013 and 2017, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions15 and ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}16. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the rates predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their high-end climate warming scenario17, which forecast an additional 70 to 130 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 compared with their central estimate.},

Moreover, intercomparison experiments are needed to reveal differences and quantify the uncertainties further. Here, we document our sampling, filtering, and analysis protocols used in the intercomparison experiment from three laboratories to detect water-insoluble carbon in seasonal surface snow in the high-mountain environment at Kolm Saigurn (47.067842\&deg; N, 12.98394\&deg; E, alt 1598 m a.s.l.), Austria. The participating laboratories were TU Wien (Austria), the University of Florence (Italy), and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (Finland). For the carbon analysis, the NIOSH5040 and EUSAAR2 protocols of the OCEC thermal-optical method were used. The median of the measured concentrations of total carbon (TC) was 323 ppb, organic carbon (OC) 308 ppb, and elemental carbon (EC) 16 ppb. The methods and protocols used in this experiment did not reveal large differences between the laboratories, and the TC, OC, and EC values of four inter-comparison locations, five meters apart, did not show meter-scale horizontal variability in surface snow. The results suggest that the presented methods are applicable for future research and monitoring of carbonaceous particles in snow. Moreover, a recommendation on the key parameters that an intercomparison experiment participant should be asked for is presented to help future investigations on carbonaceous particles in snow. The work contributes to the harmonization of the methods for measuring the snow chemistry of seasonal snow deposited on the ground.},

Given the lack of in situ information, imperfect models, and underutilized remote sensing data, it is critical to combine the available observations with a physically based model to better characterize the spatial and temporal variation of the Greenland ice sheet SMB. This work proposes a data assimilation framework that yields SMB estimates that benefit from a state-of-the-art snowpack model (Crocus) and a 16-day albedo product. Comparison of our results against in situ SMB measurements from the Kangerlussuaq transect shows that assimilation of 16-day albedo product reduces the root-mean-square error of the posterior estimates of SMB from 1,240~millimeter water equivalent per year (mmWE/yr) to 230~mmWE/yr and reduces the bias from 1,140~mmWE/yr to -20 mmWE/yr.},

	abstract = {Abstract The rate of growth or retreat of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets remains a highly uncertain component of future sea level change. Here we examine the simulation of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance (GrIS SMB) in a development branch of the ModelE2 version of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model (GCM). GCMs are often limited in their ability to represent SMB compared with polar region regional climate models. We compare ModelE2-simulated GrIS SMB for present-day (1996–2005) simulations with fixed ocean conditions, at a spatial resolution of 2\textdegree{} latitude by 2.5\textdegree{} longitude (~200~km), with SMB simulated by the Mod\`{e}le Atmosph\'{e}rique R\'{e}gionale (MAR) regional climate model (1996–2005 at a 25-km resolution). ModelE2 SMB agrees well with MAR SMB on the whole, but there are distinct spatial patterns of differences and large differences in some SMB components. The impacts of changes to the ModelE2 surface are tested, including a subgrid-scale representation of SMB with surface elevation classes. This has a minimal effect on ice sheet-wide SMB but corrects local biases. Replacing fixed surface albedo with satellite-derived values and an age-dependent scheme has a larger impact, increasing simulated melt by 60\%–100\%. We also find that lower surface albedo can enhance the effects of elevation classes. Reducing ModelE2 surface roughness length to values closer to MAR reduces sublimation by ~50\%. Further work is required to account for meltwater refreezing in ModelE2 and to understand how differences in atmospheric processes and model resolution influence simulated SMB.},

	abstract = {Recent research shows increasing decadal ice mass losses from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets and more generally from glaciers worldwide in the light of continued global warming. Here, in an update of our previous ISMASS paper (Hanna et al., 2013), we review recent observational estimates of ice sheet and glacier mass balance, and their related uncertainties, first briefly considering relevant monitoring methods. Focusing on the response to climate change during 1992–2018, and especially the post-IPCC AR5 period, we discuss recent changes in the relative contributions of ice sheets and glaciers to sea-level change. We assess recent advances in understanding of the relative importance of surface mass balance and ice dynamics in overall ice-sheet mass change. We also consider recent improvements in ice-sheet modelling, highlighting data-model linkages and the use of updated observational datasets in ice-sheet models. Finally, by identifying key deficiencies in the observations and models that hamper current understanding and limit reliability of future ice-sheet projections, we make recommendations to the research community for reducing these knowledge gaps. Our synthesis aims to provide a critical and timely review of the current state of the science in advance of the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report that is due in 2021.},

	abstract = {Ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet is one of the largest sources of contemporary sea-level rise (SLR). While process-based models place timescales on Greenland's deglaciation, their confidence is obscured by model shortcomings including imprecise atmospheric and oceanic couplings. Here, we present a complementary approach resolving ice sheet disequilibrium with climate constrained by satellite-derived bare-ice extent, tidewater sector ice flow discharge and surface mass balance data.

	abstract = {The cryosphere is an important component of the global climate system. Cryospheric components are sensitive to climate warming, and changes in the cryosphere can lead to serious hazards to human society, while the comprehensive understanding of cryospheric hazards largely remains unknown. Here we summarized the hazards related to atmospheric, oceanic and land cryosphere. The different types of cryospheric hazards, including their phenomena, mechanisms and impacts were reviewed. Our results suggested that: 1) The recorded hazards from atmospheric cryosphere including frost, hail, freezing rain decreased or showed great spatial heterogeneities, while their future changes are difficult to predict, and the extreme cold events in winter may increase in the future; 2) Sea ice extent declines rapidly, and iceberg numbers will increase. The permafrost-dominated coastline erosion will be exacerbated by climate warming. Meanwhile, the sea level rise is expected to continue in the next decades; 3) The glacier collapse, glacial lake outbursts and paraglacial readjustments will increase in the future. Although the total area of snow cover will decrease, the heavy snow events, snow avalanches, and snowmelt floods will not decrease simultaneously. The permafrost-related rock and debris flow and thaw slump will also increase with permafrost degradation. Taken together, we concluded the cryosphere is shrinking, while cryospheric hazards will likely increase in a warming climate.},

	abstract = {The global cryosphere, Earth's frozen water, is in precipitous decline. The ongoing and predicted impacts of cryosphere loss are diverse, ranging from disappearance of entire biomes to crises of water availability. Covering approximately one-fifth of the planet, mass loss from the terrestrial cryosphere is driven primarily by a warming atmosphere but reductions in albedo (the proportion of reflected light) also contribute by increasing absorption of solar radiation. In addition to dust and other abiotic impurities, biological communities substantially reduce albedo worldwide. In this review, we provide a global synthesis of biological albedo reduction (BAR) in terrestrial snow and ice ecosystems. We first focus on known drivers--algal blooms and cryoconite (granular sediment on the ice that includes both mineral and biological material)--as they account for much of the biological albedo variability in snow and ice habitats. We then consider an array of potential drivers of BAR whose impacts may be overlooked, such as arthropod deposition, resident organisms (e.g., dark-bodied glacier ice worms), and larger vertebrates, including humans, that transiently visit the cryosphere. We consider both primary (e.g., BAR due to the presence of pigmented algal cells) and indirect (e.g., nutrient addition from arthropod deposition) effects, as well as interactions among biological groups (e.g., birds feeding on ice worms). Collectively, we highlight that in many cases, overlooked drivers and interactions among factors have considerable potential to alter BAR, perhaps rivaling the direct effects of algal blooms and cryoconite. We conclude by highlighting knowledge gaps for the field with an emphasis on the underrepresentation of genomic tools, understudied areas (particularly high-elevation glaciers at tropical latitudes), and a dearth of temporal sampling in current efforts. We detail a global framework for long-term BAR monitoring that, if implemented, would yield a tremendous amount of insight for BAR and would be particularly valuable in light of the rapid ecological and physical changes occurring in the contemporary cryosphere.},

	abstract = {Abstract Sea level rise (SLR) is a long-lasting consequence of climate change because global anthropogenic warming takes centuries to millennia to equilibrate for the deep ocean and ice sheets. SLR projections based on climate models support policy analysis, risk assessment and adaptation planning today, despite their large uncertainties. The central range of the SLR distribution is estimated by process-based models. However, risk-averse practitioners often require information about plausible future conditions that lie in the tails of the SLR distribution, which are poorly defined by existing models. Here, a community effort combining scientists and practitioners builds on a framework of discussing physical evidence to quantify high-end global SLR for practitioners. The approach is complementary to the IPCC AR6 report and provides further physically plausible high-end scenarios. High-end estimates for the different SLR components are developed for two climate scenarios at two timescales. For global warming of +2\textdegree{}C in 2100 (RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6) relative to pre-industrial values our high-end global SLR estimates are up to 0.9~m in 2100 and 2.5~m in 2300. Similarly, for a (RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5), we estimate up to 1.6~m in 2100 and up to 10.4~m in 2300. The large and growing differences between the scenarios beyond 2100 emphasize the long-term benefits of mitigation. However, even a modest 2\textdegree{}C warming may cause multi-meter SLR on centennial time scales with profound consequences for coastal areas. Earlier high-end assessments focused on instability mechanisms in Antarctica, while here we emphasize the importance of the timing of ice shelf collapse around Antarctica. This is highly uncertain due to low understanding of the driving processes. Hence both process understanding and emission scenario control high-end SLR.},

	abstract = {The land ice contribution to global mean sea level rise has not yet been predicted1 using ice sheet and glacier models for the latest set of socio-economic scenarios, nor using coordinated exploration of uncertainties arising from the various computer models involved. Two recent international projects generated a large suite of projections using multiple models2--8, but primarily used previous-generation scenarios9 and climate models10, and could not fully explore known uncertainties. Here we estimate probability distributions for these projections under the new scenarios11,12 using statistical emulation of the ice sheet and glacier models. We find that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would halve the land ice contribution to twenty-first-century sea level rise, relative to current emissions pledges. The median decreases from 25 to 13 centimetres sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level contribution. The projected Antarctic contribution does not show a clear response to the emissions scenario, owing to uncertainties in the competing processes of increasing ice loss and snowfall accumulation in a warming climate. However, under risk-averse (pessimistic) assumptions, Antarctic ice loss could be five times higher, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 centimetres SLE under current policies and pledges, with the 95th percentile projection exceeding half a metre even under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. This would severely limit the possibility of mitigating future coastal flooding. Given this large range (between 13 centimetres SLE using the main projections under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 42 centimetres SLE using risk-averse projections under current pledges), adaptation planning for twenty-first-century sea level rise must account for a factor-of-three uncertainty in the land ice contribution until climate policies and the Antarctic response are further constrained.},

	abstract = {Surface albedo partitions the amount of energy received by glacier surfaces from shortwave fluxes and modulates the energy available for melt processes. The ice-albedo feedback, influenced by the contamination of bare-ice surfaces with light-absorbing impurities, plays a major role in the melting of mountain glaciers in a warming climate. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal distribution and variability of bare-ice glacier surface albedo under changing conditions. In this study, we focus on two mountain glaciers located in the western Swiss Alps and perform a cross-comparison of different albedo products. We take advantage of high spectral and spatial resolution (284 bands, 2 m) imaging spectrometer data from the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) and investigate the applicability and potential of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data to derive broadband albedo products. The performance of shortwave broadband albedo retrievals is tested and we assess the reliability of published narrow-to-broadband conversion algorithms. The resulting albedo products from the three sensors and different algorithms are further cross-compared. Moreover, the impact of the anisotropy correction is analysed depending on different surface types. While degradation of the spectral resolution impacted glacier-wide mean albedo by about 5\%, reducing the spatial resolution resulted in changes of less than 1\%. However, in any case, coarser spatial resolution was no longer able to represent small-scale variability of albedo on glacier surfaces. We discuss the implications when using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 to map dynamic glaciological processes and to monitor glacier surface albedo on larger spatial and more frequent temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Technical Debt (TD) is a software engineering metaphor that resembles the production of poorquality code to going into debt. In particular, a development team that ''saves'' effort while developing by not removing inefficiencies, has to ''pay-back'' with interest, in the form of additional maintenance costs (i.e., fixing bugs, adding features, etc.) due to the poor maintainability of the developed code. Although maintainability assurance is an established practice in traditional software development (lately known as TD management), it has still not attracted the attention of scientific software developers; i.e., researchers writing code and developing tools for purely research purposes. Nevertheless, based on the literature and practice, maintainability seems to be ranked as an important key-driver for the development of such applications; since the effort needed to update the code before the experimentation (e.g., executing a simulation) is common and should not receive low priority. In this paper, we present the outcome of a 3-year research project on Technical Debt Management (TDM) for scientific software development. The outcome of the project is a framework (termed: EXA2PRO TDM framework) and an accompanying platform for assisting scientific software developers in managing the TD of their applications. The framework is a collection of methods tailored for the mainstream programming languages of scientific software development, which have been empirically validated through five pilot applications. The majority of the EXA2PRO framework suggestions have been applied by scientific software developers and eased future maintenance activities.

	abstract = {Scientific computing libraries, whether in-house or open-source, have witnessed enormous progress in both engineering and scientific research. Therefore, it is important to ensure that modifications to the source code, prompted by bug fixing or new feature development, do not compromise the accuracy and functionality that have been already validated and verified. This paper introduces a method for establishing and implementing an automatic regression test environment, using the open-source multi-physics library SPHinXsys as an illustrative example. Initially, a reference database for each benchmark test is generated from observed data across multiple executions. This comprehensive database encapsulates the maximum variation range of metrics for different strategies, including the time-averaged, ensemble-averaged, and dynamic time warping methods. It accounts for uncertainties arising from parallel computing, particle relaxation, physical instabilities, and more. Subsequently, new results obtained after source code modifications undergo testing based on a curve-similarity comparison against the reference database. Whenever the source code is updated, the regression test is automatically executed for all test cases, providing a comprehensive assessment of the validity of the current results. This regression test environment has been successfully implemented in all dynamic test cases within SPHinXsys, including fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, thermal and mass diffusion, reaction-diffusion, and their multi-physics couplings, and demonstrates robust capabilities in testing different problems. It is noted that while the current test environment is built and implemented for a particular scientific computing library, its underlying principles are generic and can be easily adapted for use with other libraries, achieving equal effectiveness.},

Therefore, the correctness and trustworthiness of research software are of absolute importance. Software testing is an important activity for identifying problematic code and helping to produce high-quality software. However, testing of research software is difficult due to the complexity of the underlying science, relatively unknown results from scientific algorithms, and the culture of the research software community. Aims The goal of this paper is to better understand current testing practices, identify challenges, and provide recommendations on how to improve the testing process for research software development. Method We surveyed members of the research software developer community to collect information regarding their knowledge about and use of software testing in their projects. Results We analysed 120 responses and identified that even though research software developers report they have an average level of knowledge about software testing, they still find it difficult due to the numerous challenges involved. However, there are a number of ways, such as proper training, that can improve the testing process for research software. Conclusions Testing can be challenging for any type of software. This difficulty is especially present in the development of research software, where software engineering activities are typically given less attention. To produce trustworthy results from research software, there is a need for a culture change so that testing is valued and teams devote appropriate effort to writing and executing tests.},

While several resources are available for introducing scientists to the basics of programming, researchers have been left with little guidance on approaches needed to advance to the next level for the development of robust, large-scale data analysis tools that are amenable to integration into workflow management systems, tools, and frameworks. The integration into such workflow systems necessitates additional requirements on computational tools, such as adherence to standard conventions for robustness, data input, output, logging, and flow control. Here we provide a set of 10 guidelines to steer the creation of command-line computational tools that are usable, reliable, extensible, and in line with standards of modern coding practices.},

	abstract = {Context Research software is software developed by and/or used by researchers, across a wide variety of domains, to perform their research. Because of the complexity of research software, developers cannot conduct exhaustive testing. As a result, researchers have lower confidence in the correctness of the output of the software. Peer code review, a standard software engineering practice, has helped address this problem in other types of software. Objective Peer code review is less prevalent in research software than it is in other types of software. In addition, the literature does not contain any studies about the use of peer code review in research software. Therefore, through analyzing developers perceptions, the goal of this work is to understand the current practice of peer code review in the development of research software, identify challenges and barriers associated with peer code review in research software, and present approaches to improve the peer code review in research software. Method We conducted interviews and a community survey of research software developers to collect information about their current peer code review practices, difficulties they face, and how they address those difficulties. Results We received 84 unique responses from the interviews and surveys. The results show that while research software teams review a large amount of their code, they lack formal process, proper organization, and adequate people to perform the reviews. Conclusions Use of peer code review is promising for improving the quality of research software and thereby improving the trustworthiness of the underlying research results. In},

	abstract = {The development of scientific software applications is far from trivial, due to the constant increase in the necessary complexity of these applications, their increasing size, and their need for intensive maintenance and reuse. Aim: To this end, developers of scientific software (who usually lack a formal computer science background) need to use appropriate software engineering (SE) practices. This paper describes the results of a systematic mapping study on the use of SE for scientific application development and their impact on software quality. Method: To achieve this goal we have performed a systematic mapping study on 359 papers. We first describe a catalogue of SE practices used in scientific software development. Then, we discuss the quality attributes of interest that drive the application of these practices, as well as tentative side-effects of applying the practices on qualities. Results: The main findings indicate that scientific software developers are focusing on practices that improve implementation productivity, such as code reuse, use of third-party libraries, and the application of "good" programming techniques. In addition, apart from the finding that performance is a key-driver for many of these applications, scientific software developers also find maintainability and productivity to be important. Conclusions: The results of the study are compared to existing literature, are interpreted under a software engineering prism, and various implications for researchers and practitioners are provided. One of the key findings of the study, which is considered as important for driving future research endeavors is the lack of evidence on the tradeoffs that need to be made when applying a software practice, i.e., negative (indirect) effects on other quality attributes.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.infsof.2016.04.015},
	abstract = {Context: Many organizations see software test automation as a solution to decrease testing costs and to reduce cycle time in software development. However, establishment of automated testing may fail if test automation is not applied in the right time, right context and with the appropriate approach. Objective: The decisions on when and what to automate is important since wrong decisions can lead to disappointments and major wrong expenditures (resources and effort s). To support decision making on when and what to automate, researchers and practitioners have proposed various guidelines, heuristics and factors since the early days of test automation technologies. As the number of such sources has increased, it is important to systematically categorize the current state-of-the-art and-practice, and to provide a synthesized overview. Method: To achieve the above objective, we have performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) study on when and what to automate in software testing. A MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). We searched the academic literature using the Google Scholar and the grey literature using the regular Google search engine. Results: Our MLR and its results are based on 78 sources, 52 of which were grey literature and 26 were formally published sources. We used the qualitative analysis (coding) to classify the factors affecting the when-and what-to-automate questions to five groups: (1) Software Under Test (SUT)-related factors, (2) test-related factors, (3) test-tool-related factors, (4) human and organizational factors, and (5) cross-cutting and other factors. The most frequent individual factors were: need for regression testing (44 sources), economic factors (43), and maturity of SUT (39). Conclusion: We show that current decision-support in software test automation provides reasonable advice for industry, and as a practical outcome of this research we have summarized it as a checklist that can be used by practitioners. However, we recommend developing systematic empirically-validated decision-support approaches as the existing advice is often unsystematic and based on weak empirical evidence.},

	abstract = {Context Scientific software plays an important role in critical decision making, for example making weather predictions based on climate models, and computation of evidence for research publications. Recently, scientists have had to retract publications due to errors caused by software faults. Systematic testing can identify such faults in code. Objective This study aims to identify specific challenges, proposed solutions, and unsolved problems faced when testing scientific software. Method We conducted a systematic literature survey to identify and analyze relevant literature. We identified 62 studies that provided relevant information about testing scientific software. Results We found that challenges faced when testing scientific software fall into two main categories: (1) testing challenges that occur due to characteristics of scientific software such as oracle problems and (2) testing challenges that occur due to cultural differences between scientists and the software engineering community such as viewing the code and the model that it implements as inseparable entities. In addition, we identified methods to potentially overcome these challenges and their limitations. Finally we describe unsolved challenges and how software engineering researchers and practitioners can help to overcome them. Conclusions Scientific software presents special challenges for testing. Specifically, cultural differences between scientist developers and software engineers, along with the characteristics of the scientific software make testing more difficult. Existing techniques such as code clone detection can help to improve the testing process. Software engineers should consider special challenges posed by scientific software such as oracle problems when developing testing techniques.},

	abstract = {Avalanche forecasting is essential for safety in mountainous regions where avalanches threaten human life and infrastructure. Traditional methods for assessing avalanche risk, such as snow pit analysis, are challenging to apply over extensive areas due to their intensive labor and resource requirements. In this study, we explore the potential of satellite-based data for avalanche forecasting by leveraging a dataset of nearly half a million avalanche detections in Norway from 2016 to 2020. This dataset enables a data-driven approach to identifying meteorological precursors to avalanches. We present the methodology for integrating time series of avalanche activity with numerical weather prediction (NWP) data using spatio-temporal deep learning models. We introduce a prototype model and discuss the primary challenges in training this architecture. This framework lays the foundation for improved avalanche forecasting over large regions where in-situ measurements are sparse or unavailable.},

	abstract = {The effects of surface roughness on spectral and broadband (spectrally integrated) albedos of sea ice are investigated using a multiple scattering radiative transfer model for the atmosphere-snow/ice system (ARTMASS2). The model accounts for multiple scattering, incorporating Mie theory and geometric optics approximation for single scattering by various components such as snow grains, air bubbles, brine pockets, and cloud droplets across a wavelength range from 0.3 to 4.0\ensuremath{\mu}m. To account for the refractive index change at the air-ice interface, we introduced an ice surface reflection model. Recognizing the irregularity of sea ice surfaces, we integrated surface roughness into this model. Our findings indicate that sea ice surface roughness can significantly alter both spectral and broadband albedos. Particularly for bare sea ice, surface roughness plays a significant role in albedo variation.},

	abstract = {Ice surface albedo is a primary modulator of melt and runoff, yet our understanding of how reflectance varies over time across the Greenland Ice Sheet remains poor. This is due to a disconnect between point or transect scale albedo sampling and the coarser spatial, spectral and/or temporal resolutions of available satellite products. Here, we present time-series of bare-ice surface reflectance data that span a range of length scales, from the 500 m for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer's MOD10A1 product, to 10 m for Sentinel-2 imagery, 0.1 m spot measurements from ground-based field spectrometry, and 2.5 cm from uncrewed aerial drone imagery. Our results reveal broad similarities in seasonal patterns in bare-ice reflectance, but further analysis identifies short-term dynamics in reflectance distribution that are unique to each dataset. Using these distributions, we demonstrate that areal mean reflectance is the primary control on local ablation rates, and that the spatial distribution of specific ice types and impurities is secondary. Given the rapid changes in mean reflectance observed in the datasets presented, we propose that albedo parameterizations can be improved by (i) quantitative assessment of the representativeness of time-averaged reflectance data products, and, (ii) using temporally-resolved functions to describe the variability in impurity distribution at daily time-scales. We conclude that the regional melt model performance may not be optimally improved by increased spatial resolution and the incorporation of sub-pixel heterogeneity, but instead, should focus on the temporal dynamics of bare-ice albedo.},

	comment = {Greenland's surface melt and mass balance is highly sensitive to seasonal albedo variations . The detail of short-term spatiotemporal reflectance dynamics in the bare-ice regions remains poorly resolved and crudely represented in regional climate models . This, therefore, represents an important research goal for accurate projection of the ice sheet's surface mass balance and contribution to sea-level rise.
